      "job_description": "About Us Logistics is broken. Let’s fix it. We are a team of engineers, product designers, and customer champions applying the most transformative technology of our times, AI, to one of the largest industries in the world: logistics. Our mission is to streamline freight brokerage, carrier management, and 3PL operations through automation, freeing teams to focus on high-value strategic work. We are looking for customer success leaders with deep expertise in freight, logistics, and technology implementation to help scale our impact. If you're excited about managing a high-performing team and optimizing customer workflows with AI-driven solutions, we want to hear from you. Overview We’re building out our first Forward-Deployed Engineering team at Augment — a new function designed to connect our product, customers, and engineering teams in a tighter loop. As a F orward-Deployed Engineer (FDE) , you’ll be the hands-on technical partner who helps customers bring their workflows to life — troubleshooting issues in real time, building small but critical integrations, and making sure our AI systems run smoothly in production. This role exists to help customers move faster while keeping our engineering teams focused on core product innovation. FDEs sit right at the intersection — embedded with customers, technical enough to dig into complex problems, and collaborative enough to translate between business needs and product realities. If you love solving tough, high-impact problems alongside smart, collaborative teammates, you’ll fit right in. What You’ll Do You’ll be the technical heartbeat between customers and our internal teams — turning ideas and prototypes into live, working solutions. Partner with customers, Customer Success, and Engineering to implement, test, and deploy AI-powered workflows. Work closely with customers to understand their data, integrations, and daily workflows. Read logs, trace API calls, and dig into configurations to identify root causes. Collaborate with engineering to reproduce and fix low-complexity bugs. Build lightweight scripts, integrations, or configuration patches to keep customers moving. Translate customer pain points into technical tasks the engineering team can act on. Provide structured, thoughtful feedback to product and engineering on what’s working (and what’s not). Build reusable frameworks and playbooks that make future implementations faster and smoother. Help define what forward-deployed engineering looks like at Augment — shaping process, documentation, and culture. What We’re Looking For 1–5 years of experience in a technical, implementation, or customer-facing engineering role (or equivalent hands-on projects). Strong systems and architecture thinking — you understand how APIs, data, and workflows connect. Comfortable working with AI models — authoring, testing, and validating prompts to ensure reliable, high-quality results in customer workflows. Some scripting proficiency (Python, Node.js, or similar) — AI-assisted is fine, but you should be confident writing and debugging small pieces of code when needed. Solid product intuition — you can identify expected behavior, assess whether a customer issue or feature request aligns with product principles, and communicate that clearly. Ability to read logs, trace errors, and investigate broken workflows end-to-end. Excellent communication skills — you can explain technical concepts clearly to non-technical stakeholders. Collaborative by nature — you love working across teams and helping others solve problems. Thrive in ambiguity — you’re scrappy, curious, and proactive when things aren’t fully defined. Bonus Points For: Experience in logistics, supply chain, or transportation (TMS, WMS, ERP systems). Familiarity with AI tooling or automation frameworks (LangChain, Claude, GPT, Bedrock, etc.). Prior experience in high-growth startups or applied AI environments. Comfort working with APIs, message queues, or system integrations. Why Join Us? Competitive Salary + Stock Options Comprehensive Health, Vision, and Dental Benefits Flexible PTO On-site Gym Monthly stipend About Augment At Augment, we set out to create a fully autonomous AI platform that streamlines operations and reclaims the human element in logistics. Our founders recognized a pattern: talented professionals were stuck handling manual data entry, phone calls, and repetitive tasks, instead of focusing on high-impact problem-solving and strategic decision-making. That insight became our mission—to free logistics professionals from busywork so they can focus on what truly drives business growth. Augment isn’t just about efficiency; it’s about transforming an entire industry by empowering teams with AI-driven solutions that make logistics smarter, faster, and more adaptive. Join us on this journey! Augment is an Equal Opportunity Employer and values diversity at our company. We consider all qualified applicants without regard to race, color, religion, national origin, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, disability, or any other legally protected status. Augment complies with federal, state, and local laws regarding equal employment opportunity and reasonable accommodation. If you need assistance or an accommodation during the application or interview process, please contact your recruiter. We also consider qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records in accordance with applicable federal, state and local fair-chance / ban-the-box laws (for example, but not limited to, the California Fair Chance Act).",
