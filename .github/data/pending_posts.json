      "job_description": "About the Role Work on open ended problems centered around software engineering, with exposure to electrical engineering, machine learning, and/or payments. Become an expert in building systems that can scale to processing millions of users, transactions, car detections, payments etc. Learn with urgency, independently, and using your peers as sparing partners for ideas. Your work will be meaningful to the company right away. There are no useless Blissway employees, everyone’s work must be essential. You will be trusted to make your own decisions and share the responsibility of prioritizing our goals with the team. No dedicated PMs to tell you what to do. What we offer Annual salary between $125k and $175k depending on experience; significant stock option package; top-tier medical, vision and dental insurance; 401k. Hybrid work. Work three days a week at HQ in South Denver. Rest of the week is up to you. Four weeks of vacation per year. We push you to take them! At-the-office breakfast, lunch, and snacks are on the company. About Blissway The company is profitable; We say most of our problems are 1 to 100, with a few still 0 to 1. Blissway is a startup that simplifies the collection of tolls and greatly improves highway safety. In a way, we are multiple startups in one: deep tech, AI/ML, fintech, hardware, SaaS, IoT, transportation, and GovTech. For the past five years we have built a nearly insurmountable software &amp; hardware technological lead in tolling and highway safety, under-the-radar industries that are bigger than football. Demand for Blissway’s tech is such that we stopped taking government contracts for 2025. With a 20-person all-star team achieving more than competitors with 4k employees, this is your opportunity to have an oversized impact in the massive Interstate Highway System covering every metropolitan area in the US (well, minus Juneau AK). You are a good fit if you Are smart, hard working, and care about the work that you do. You like a challenge. Code really well. Which language you are most proficient is not important, as long as you learn fast. We mostly use Python and Typescript. Have incredible eye for detail. Takes ownership of projects and puts in the necessary time to meet deadlines. A recent company survey showed the team is averaging 50 hours to get their tasks done, with occasional bursts for bigger deadlines. Excel at solving hard problems and take full ownership. We expect you to figure out what you need to get stuff done. Flexible to help all areas of the company when other teams need a boost. Usually this is a great opportunity to learn and get exposure to new tech. If you are uncomfortable with the idea of fluid teams or only want to work on niche things, this will not be a good fit. We have extremely talented SWE team members who want you to learn and succeed. They will guide you but this would be a bad fit if you are hoping a training program, you must throw yourself at the problems. If you want to learn more, let's talk!",

      "job_description": "Because of the drastically increasing demand from AI/ML applications, the computing hardware industry has gravitated towards data formats narrower than the IEEE double format that most computational scientists and engineers are accustomed to. Moreover, the vast majority of the performance associated with these reduced precision formats resides on special hardware units such as tensor cores on NVIDIA GPUs, which specialize for a restricted set of floating point operations only. Many scientific applications, particularly those that are physics-driven and mission-critical, still struggle to adapt to this new hardware trend.  To help bridge the gap, the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF) invites applications for a postdoctoral appointment on the subject of mixed/reduced precision computing on modern hardware. Duration of the appointment is one year initially and renewable for up to three years contingent on performance and funding. The successful candidate will be supported by ALCF's Performance Engineering group and is encouraged to engage with the broader Argonne scientific community. Moreover, the successful candidate is encouraged to experiment on the wide variety of systems available at ACLF, including both the large-scale production machines and the testbed machines featuring novel architectures such as Cerebras and SambaNova.  The list below provides examples of the potential tasks for the successful candidate and illustrates the general nature of the work but is not intended to be exhaustive. In addition, the successful candidate is encouraged to bring their inputs in the research direction during the appointment.  Diagnosing and analyzing the numerical challenges related to the narrower data width Devising and evaluating novel techniques to exploit the reduced precision hardware Incorporating mixed/reduced precision into existing applications relevant to ALCF's mission Developing and maintaining tools and libraries that facilitate the adoption of mixed/reduced precision computing in the broader community Collaborating with domain experts to understand how the trend of reduced precision hardware impacts their practices and provide support in return Publishing and presenting at professional venues Position RequirementsRequired skills and qualifications:A PhD degree completed within the last 0-5 years (or soon to be completed) in numerical analysis, applied mathematics, computational science, computer science, or another relevant fieldIndependent research experience Proficiency in programming and knowledge on computing hardware Ability and willingness to work collaboratively in a team environmentEffective written and oral communication and interpersonal skills Ability to model Argonne’s core values of impact, safety, respect, integrity, and teamwork Preferred skills and qualifications:Knowledge on floating point arithmetic and mixed/reduced precision computing techniques Experience with programming GPUs and/or other accelerators Proficiency in mathematical reasoning and numerical analysis Up-to-date awareness about the status and trend of the computing hardware industry Interest in working with domain experts on practical problems Experience with large-scale distributed systems Knowledge on numerical linear algebra, numerical methods, high performance computing, or other related fields  Job FamilyPostdoctoralJob ProfilePostdoctoral AppointeeWorker TypeLong-Term (Fixed Term)Time TypeFull timeThe expected hiring range for this position is $72,879.00-$121,465.00.Please note that the pay range information is a general guideline only.
