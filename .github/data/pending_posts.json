But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

We expect you to be in-office 4 days per week during your first few months, with the opportunity to work remotely up to 2 days per week after that.

We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.

How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

While this team works on engineering workflows, the focus is on workflows that operate within the context of Figma’s product and customer environments—enabling teams to support, administer, and debug real customer scenarios—rather than tooling for the software development lifecycle itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This role is ideal for someone who enjoys operating in ambiguous, cross-functional spaces, amplifying the impact of strong ICs, and driving outcomes through platform leverage.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a full time role that can be held from one of our US hubs or remotely in the United States.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you&#39;ll do at Figma:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Lead and support a team of senior engineers building internal platforms and workflows used across Figma&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Provide clear ownership and continuity for complex, cross-functional initiatives that span Product Support, Legal, Program Management, and Engineering&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Reduce cross-organizational coordination overhead so engineers can focus on high-leverage technical work&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Partner deeply with CX (Product Support) to understand desired outcomes and translate them into scalable platform capabilities&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ensure security, privacy, reliability, and operational safety are treated as non-negotiable in all work&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Balance short-term partner needs with long-term platform leverage and sustainability&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Bring clarity and structure to ambiguous problem spaces while maintaining strong delivery discipline&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’d love to hear from you if you have:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience managing senior, high-performing software engineers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A track record of leading complex, cross-functional initiatives without dedicated PM or TPM support&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Strong judgment around prioritization, tradeoffs, and long-term technical sustainability&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience partnering closely with operational teams such as Product Support, Trust &amp;amp; Safety, Legal, or similar&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The ability to lead through influence, build trust with stakeholders, and challenge problem framing constructively&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While it’s not required, it’s an added plus if you also have:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience stewarding shared internal platforms with many downstream consumers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with security- or privacy-sensitive systems and workflows&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience operating in environments with high ambiguity and evolving requirements&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A background in platform, infrastructure, or internal tooling teams&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;section page-centered&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;section page-centered&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;At Figma, one of our values is Grow as you go.

We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day.

At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco.

However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day.

At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

Our Forward Deployed Engineers embed directly with strategic customers to ship production AI applications that solve real business problems. As this practice grows, we need a founding leader to build and scale it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=&quot;p5&quot;&gt;As the first FDE Manager, you&#39;ll own the team that sits at the frontier of enterprise AI deployment. You&#39;ll hire and develop a high-performing team of FDEs, set the technical and operational bar for customer engagements, and build the playbooks that turn one-off successes into repeatable patterns. You&#39;ll work hand-in-hand with Engagement Managers who own delivery logistics and stakeholder management, while you ensure your team is shipping quality code, growing technically, and representing Anthropic at the highest level in customer environments.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=&quot;p5&quot;&gt;This is a player-coach role with a strong bias toward leadership. You&#39;ll stay close enough to the technical work to review architectures, debug production issues, and pair with your team when it matters — but your primary impact will come from the people you hire, the standards you set, and the culture you create. You&#39;ll partner cross-functionally with Sales, Product, and Engineering to shape how Anthropic serves its most strategic customers, and your team&#39;s field insights will directly influence product direction.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=&quot;p5&quot;&gt;This role requires someone who thrives in ambiguity and is energized by building from zero to one. You&#39;ll be defining what good looks like for FDE management at Anthropic — there is no existing playbook to follow.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=&quot;p6&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul class=&quot;ul1&quot;&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;li7&quot;&gt;Hire, develop, and retain a world-class team of Forward Deployed Engineers. Set a high bar for technical talent and customer instincts.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;li7&quot;&gt;Conduct regular 1:1s, provide technical mentorship, and invest in the career growth of each team member. Create an environment where FDEs do the best work of their careers.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;li7&quot;&gt;Staff and oversee customer engagements across your team&#39;s portfolio, making resource allocation decisions that balance customer needs, team development, and business priorities.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;li7&quot;&gt;Collaborate with account teams and Engagement Managers during the pre-sales process to qualify engagements, scope work, and inform statements of work.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;li7&quot;&gt;Review technical architectures and code produced by your FDEs, ensuring the team ships high-quality, production-ready solutions that solve real customer problems.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;li7&quot;&gt;Stay hands-on enough to lead technical discovery sessions, prototype solutions, and debug complex issues alongside your team when needed.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;li7&quot;&gt;Build repeatable playbooks, starter repositories, integration templates, and an internal knowledge base that captures what your team learns in the field.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;li7&quot;&gt;Define team OKRs that tie to customer success outcomes and product adoption goals. Create operational cadences — standups, retros, engagement reviews — that keep the team aligned.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;li7&quot;&gt;Partner with Product and Engineering to translate field insights into product improvements.

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Anthropic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=&quot;p5&quot;&gt;Anthropic&#39;s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=&quot;p5&quot;&gt;Anthropic is building the Applied AI team to help the world&#39;s most ambitious organizations adopt Claude in ways that are transformative, safe, and lasting. Our Forward Deployed Engineers embed directly with strategic customers to ship production AI applications that solve real business problems. As this practice grows, we need a founding leader to build and scale it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=&quot;p5&quot;&gt;As the first FDE Manager, you&#39;ll own the team that sits at the frontier of enterprise AI deployment. You&#39;ll hire and develop a high-performing team of FDEs, set the technical and operational bar for customer engagements, and build the playbooks that turn one-off successes into repeatable patterns. You&#39;ll work hand-in-hand with Engagement Managers who own delivery logistics and stakeholder management, while you ensure your team is shipping quality code, growing technically, and representing Anthropic at the highest level in customer environments.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=&quot;p5&quot;&gt;This is a player-coach role with a strong bias toward leadership. You&#39;ll stay close enough to the technical work to review architectures, debug production issues, and pair with your team when it matters — but your primary impact will come from the people you hire, the standards you set, and the culture you create. You&#39;ll partner cross-functionally with Sales, Product, and Engineering to shape how Anthropic serves its most strategic customers, and your team&#39;s field insights will directly influence product direction.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=&quot;p5&quot;&gt;This role requires someone who thrives in ambiguity and is energized by building from zero to one. You&#39;ll be defining what good looks like for FDE management at Anthropic — there is no existing playbook to follow.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=&quot;p6&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul class=&quot;ul1&quot;&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;li7&quot;&gt;Hire, develop, and retain a world-class team of Forward Deployed Engineers. Set a high bar for technical talent and customer instincts.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;li7&quot;&gt;Conduct regular 1:1s, provide technical mentorship, and invest in the career growth of each team member. Create an environment where FDEs do the best work of their careers.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;li7&quot;&gt;Staff and oversee customer engagements across your team&#39;s portfolio, making resource allocation decisions that balance customer needs, team development, and business priorities.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;li7&quot;&gt;Collaborate with account teams and Engagement Managers during the pre-sales process to qualify engagements, scope work, and inform statements of work.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;li7&quot;&gt;Review technical architectures and code produced by your FDEs, ensuring the team ships high-quality, production-ready solutions that solve real customer problems.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;li7&quot;&gt;Stay hands-on enough to lead technical discovery sessions, prototype solutions, and debug complex issues alongside your team when needed.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;li7&quot;&gt;Build repeatable playbooks, starter repositories, integration templates, and an internal knowledge base that captures what your team learns in the field.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;li7&quot;&gt;Define team OKRs that tie to customer success outcomes and product adoption goals. Create operational cadences — standups, retros, engagement reviews — that keep the team aligned.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;li7&quot;&gt;Partner with Product and Engineering to translate field insights into product improvements. Serve as the voice of the customer in internal planning.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;li5&quot;&gt;Travel to customer sites as needed (25-50%), particularly during engagement kickoffs and for your team&#39;s highest-priority accounts.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p class=&quot;p6&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You May Be a Good Fit If You Have&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul class=&quot;ul1&quot;&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;li7&quot;&gt;10+ years of experience in software engineering, solutions architecture, or a technical customer-facing role such as forward deployed engineering or consulting.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;li7&quot;&gt;2+ years of people management experience within a services/post-sales/FDE organization with a track record of hiring, developing, and retaining strong engineers.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;li7&quot;&gt;Experience building organizations from 0-&amp;gt;1,&amp;nbsp;not just inheriting an existing one.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;li7&quot;&gt;Experience working directly with enterprise customers on technical implementations, including comfort navigating complex organizational dynamics.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;li7&quot;&gt;Executive presence with the ability to move fluidly between strategic conversations with senior stakeholders and hands-on debugging sessions with engineers.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;li7&quot;&gt;Strong written and verbal communication skills.

We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco.

However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;About the role&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is seeking a Finance Strategic Initiatives&amp;nbsp;leader to complex and impactful initiatives cross-functionally. You will partner with the Controller, CFO, and senior leadership to orchestrate complex, multi-quarter programs that require exceptional executive-level stakeholder management and change management expertise.

However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco.

Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day.

At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco.

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is seeking talented and experienced Software Engineers to join our Builds team within the Developer Platform organization. The Builds team owns the build infrastructure that every engineer and researcher at Anthropic depends on—from hermetic build environments and container image pipelines to remote build execution, build caching, and dependency management across our monorepo. By joining this team, you&#39;ll have a direct impact on the velocity and reliability of Anthropic&#39;s research and product development.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As Anthropic scales its engineering organization, research ambitions, and the volume of code contributed by both humans and AI agents, build infrastructure is becoming a critical bottleneck and a critical lever.

From idea to product, Figma empowers teams to streamline workflows, move faster, and work together in real time from anywhere in the world. If you&#39;re excited to shape the future of design and collaboration, join us!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re looking for a strategic, detail-obsessed Program Manager to own and scale our global real estate and facilities function.

You’ll operate behind the scenes to orchestrate complex projects, bring structure to ambiguity, and partner across teams to make real estate decisions feel intentional, predictable, and scalable.

      "description": "&lt;div class=&quot;content-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Figma is growing our team of passionate creatives and builders on a mission to make design accessible to all. Figma’s platform helps teams bring ideas to life—whether you&#39;re brainstorming, creating a prototype, translating designs into code, or iterating with AI. From idea to product, Figma empowers teams to streamline workflows, move faster, and work together in real time from anywhere in the world. If you&#39;re excited to shape the future of design and collaboration, join us!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re looking for a strategic, detail-obsessed Program Manager to own and scale our global real estate and facilities function. In this role, you’ll be responsible for managing our real estate portfolio end to end — from site selection and lease negotiations through buildouts, move-ins, and ongoing operations — ensuring our spaces support how our teams work today and how we’ll grow tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This role is about building and running the engine, not just reacting to requests. You’ll operate behind the scenes to orchestrate complex projects, bring structure to ambiguity, and partner across teams to make real estate decisions feel intentional, predictable, and scalable. While you’ll collaborate closely with senior leaders and external partners, this is a hands-on ownership role for someone who likes to be in the details and accountable for outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a full time role that can be held from our San Francisco Hub.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;What you’ll do at Figma:&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Own and lead the global real estate portfolio end to end — from strategy and site selection to lease negotiations, renewals, expansions, and exits — ensuring alignment with business needs and growth plans&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Lead all major facility projects and office buildouts, managing scope, budgets, timelines, vendors, and day-to-day execution from concept through move-in&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Design scalable systems, processes, and documentation for how we evaluate space, manage leases, run projects, and operate offices across regions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Manage the operational details of real estate and facilities work — contracts, approvals, documentation, timelines, risks, and communications — ensuring nothing slips through the cracks&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Partner cross-functionally with Finance, Legal, Workplace, Security, People, and business leaders to align real estate decisions with broader company priorities&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build and maintain real estate financial models and scenarios (e.g., total cost of occupancy, capex/opex tradeoffs) to support clear, data-informed decision-making&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Communicate clearly and confidently with senior leaders and the C-suite, translating complex real estate considerations into actionable recommendations&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Continuously evolve how we approach real estate and facilities to support a fast-growing, global company — balancing speed, quality, cost, and employee experience&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;section page-centered&quot;&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;We&#39;d love to hear from you if you have:&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li data-start=&quot;143&quot; data-end=&quot;331&quot;&gt;7+ years of experience in active real estate or facilities management, with direct ownership of leases, negotiations, and buildout projects across domestic and international markets&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li data-start=&quot;334&quot; data-end=&quot;459&quot;&gt;Strong fluency in real estate financials, with the ability to model, explain, and evaluate costs, tradeoffs, and risks&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li data-start=&quot;462&quot; data-end=&quot;573&quot;&gt;High ownership mindset and attention to detail — you take things end-to-end and ensure they get finished&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li data-start=&quot;576&quot; data-end=&quot;739&quot;&gt;Comfort operating in ambiguity, bringing structure, systems, and scalable processes to fast-moving environments while supporting a great employee experience&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li data-start=&quot;742&quot; data-end=&quot;882&quot;&gt;Clear, thoughtful communicator and cross-functional partner, able to influence stakeholders and senior leaders without formal authority&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;While not required, it’s an added plus if you also have:&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience supporting high-growth tech companies or startups&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Overseen real estate portfolios across multiple regions simultaneously&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have a background in facilities operations or workplace experience&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Enjoy building templates, playbooks, dashboards, and repeatable workflows from scratch&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience managing vendors and negotiations in complex or unfamiliar markets&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;section page-centered&quot;&gt;At Figma, one of our values is Grow as you go.

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Cloud Inference team scales and optimizes Claude to serve the massive audiences of developers and enterprise companies across AWS, GCP, Azure, and future cloud service providers (CSPs). We own the end-to-end product of Claude on each cloud platform—from API integration and intelligent request routing to inference execution, capacity management, and day-to-day operations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our engineers are extremely high leverage: we simultaneously drive multiple major revenue streams while optimizing one of Anthropic&#39;s most precious resources—compute. As we expand to more cloud platforms, the complexity of managing inference efficiently across providers with different hardware, networking stacks, and operational models grows significantly. We need engineers who can navigate these platform differences, build robust abstractions that work across providers, and make smart infrastructure decisions that keep us cost-effective at massive scale.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Your work will increase the scale at which our services operate, accelerate our ability to reliably launch new frontier models and innovative features to customers across all platforms, and ensure our LLMs meet rigorous safety, performance, and security standards.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What You&#39;ll Do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Design and build infrastructure that serves Claude across multiple CSPs, accounting for differences in compute hardware, networking, APIs, and operational models&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Collaborate with CSP partner engineering teams to resolve operational issues, influence provider roadmaps, and stand up end-to-end serving on new cloud platforms&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Design and evolve CI/CD automation systems, including validation and deployment pipelines, that reliably ship new model versions to millions of users across cloud platforms without regressions&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Design interfaces and tooling abstractions across CSPs that enable cost-effective inference management, scale across providers, and reduce per-platform complexity&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Contribute to capacity planning and autoscaling strategies that dynamically match supply with demand across CSP validation and production workloads&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Optimize inference cost and performance across providers—designing workload placement and routing systems that direct requests to the most cost-effective accelerator and region&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Contribute to inference features that must work consistently across all platforms&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Analyze observability data across providers to identify performance bottlenecks, cost anomalies, and regressions, and drive remediation based on real-world production workloads&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You May Be a Good Fit If You:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have significant software engineering experience, with a strong background in high-performance, large-scale distributed systems serving millions of users&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have experience building or operating services on at least one major cloud platform (AWS, GCP, or Azure), with exposure to Kubernetes, Infrastructure as Code or container orchestration&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have strong interest in inference&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Thrive in cross-functional collaboration with both internal teams and external partners&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are a fast learner who can quickly ramp up on new technologies, hardware platforms, and provider ecosystems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are highly autonomous and self-driven,

However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

platforms&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Design and evolve CI/CD automation systems, including validation and deployment pipelines, that reliably ship new model versions to millions of users across cloud platforms without regressions&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Design interfaces and tooling abstractions across CSPs that enable cost-effective inference management, scale across providers, and reduce per-platform complexity&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Contribute to capacity planning and autoscaling strategies that dynamically match supply with demand across CSP validation and production workloads&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Optimize inference cost and performance across providers—designing workload placement and routing systems that direct requests to the most cost-effective accelerator and region&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Contribute to inference features that must work consistently across all platforms&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Analyze observability data across providers to identify performance bottlenecks, cost anomalies, and regressions, and drive remediation based on real-world production workloads&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You May Be a Good Fit If You:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have significant software engineering experience, with a strong background in high-performance, large-scale distributed systems serving millions of users&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have experience building or operating services on at least one major cloud platform (AWS, GCP, or Azure), with exposure to Kubernetes, Infrastructure as Code or container orchestration&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have strong interest in inference&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Thrive in cross-functional collaboration with both internal teams and external partners&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are a fast learner who can quickly ramp up on new technologies, hardware platforms, and provider ecosystems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are highly autonomous and self-driven,

degree in a related field or equivalent experience.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Location-based hybrid policy:&lt;/strong&gt; Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

Discord plays a uniquely important role in the future of gaming. We are focused on making it easier and more fun for people to talk and hang out before, during, and after playing games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Engagement organization at Discord is focused on deepening user engagement and retention—ensuring that as we bring in new users, they stick around and make Discord an irreplaceable part of their daily lives. We work on Discord&#39;s core social systems: voice and messaging. Our mission is to drive repeatable mechanisms that increase engagement across both our core desktop gaming audience and emerging segments like mobile gamers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re looking for an experienced Product Design Manager to lead a team of designers working on one of these strategic themes. You&#39;ll manage designers tackling challenges like making voice calls more discoverable and engaging, creating social feedback loops that keep conversations going, or ensuring Discord&#39;s foundational experiences remain world-class.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a Design Manager, you&#39;ll independently lead your team across a single domain, balancing strategic thinking with hands-on craft leadership.

Especially fluent with mobile product development and consumer products, with experience using prototyping tools to demonstrate product concepts.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A portfolio of work you&#39;ve designed and shipped as well as examples of work you directed delivered by your team. Examples of how you have previously influenced your product teams, organizations or discipline.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;An enjoyment of people leadership. This includes recruiting, training and developing, organization design, and leading by example.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Strong eye for craft. You can identify when work can benefit from more time or investment, identifying gaps in visual or interaction design.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;History of strong partnerships with engineering and product management leadership.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You thrive in ambiguous environments and get excited about figuring out strategies or processes to address them—both in product and internal team structures.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You are a first principles thinker that can work with others to come up with pragmatic solutions.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Designing yourself does not scare you, and you&#39;re happy to jump in to help if needed. You are still a designer even if you don&#39;t do it all the time.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;The US base salary range for this full-time position is $220,000 to $247,500 + equity + benefits.

      "description": "&lt;div class=&quot;content-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discord is used by over 200 million people every month for many different reasons, but there’s one thing that nearly everyone does on our platform:&lt;strong&gt; play video games.&lt;/strong&gt; Over 90% of our users play games, spending a combined 1.5 billion hours playing thousands of unique titles on Discord each month. Discord plays a uniquely important role in the future of gaming. We are focused on making it easier and more fun for people to talk and hang out before, during, and after playing games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Engagement organization at Discord is focused on deepening user engagement and retention—ensuring that as we bring in new users, they stick around and make Discord an irreplaceable part of their daily lives. We work on Discord&#39;s core social systems: voice and messaging. Our mission is to drive repeatable mechanisms that increase engagement across both our core desktop gaming audience and emerging segments like mobile gamers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re looking for an experienced Product Design Manager to lead a team of designers working on one of these strategic themes. You&#39;ll manage designers tackling challenges like making voice calls more discoverable and engaging, creating social feedback loops that keep conversations going, or ensuring Discord&#39;s foundational experiences remain world-class.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a Design Manager, you&#39;ll independently lead your team across a single domain, balancing strategic thinking with hands-on craft leadership. You&#39;ll work closely with cross-functional partners in Product and Engineering to translate Engagement&#39;s strategy into delightful user experiences, while developing your designers and maintaining Discord&#39;s high quality bar.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;What You&#39;ll Be Doing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Develop a team of highly-engaged designers by coaching and instilling a sense of ownership and impact.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Provide direction and guidance of product designers&#39; output, promote partnerships and design process.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build close bonds with your corresponding engineering and product management leaders to influence product strategy and ensure world-class product execution.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Partner with Staff+ designers and XFN partners to define and refine the design portions of the roadmap, ensuring work is appropriately broken down and prioritized.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Set a strong pace for the team and foster a culture of quality by balancing holistic thinking with feature impact, cutting scope when needed without compromising quality.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Make sound first-principle decisions around resourcing and team composition, adapting to changing needs or tuning team dynamics.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Drive design excellence within your team and owned systems; mentor designers on user-centric thinking and risk mitigation.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Occasionally be hands-on with design work, pitching in to support your team and keep them focused on deeper work—however this is primarily a management role.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you should have&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;2+ years of experience as a Design Manager and/or have led at least 2 Product Designers previously within a design team.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;6+ years experience in multi-platform digital products as a Product Designer (or similar role). Especially fluent with mobile product development and consumer products, with experience using prototyping tools to demonstrate product concepts.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A portfolio of work you&#39;ve designed and shipped as well as examples of work you directed delivered by your team. Examples of how you have previously influenced your product teams, organizations or discipline.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;An enjoyment of people leadership. This includes recruiting, training and developing, organization design, and leading by example.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Strong eye for craft. You can identify when work can benefit from more time or investment, identifying gaps in visual or interaction design.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;History of strong partnerships with engineering and product management leadership.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You thrive in ambiguous environments and get excited about figuring out strategies or processes to address them—both in product and internal team structures.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You are a first principles thinker that can work with others to come up with pragmatic solutions.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Designing yourself does not scare you, and you&#39;re happy to jump in to help if needed. You are still a designer even if you don&#39;t do it all the time.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;The US base salary range for this full-time position is $220,000 to $247,500 + equity + benefits. Our salary ranges are determined by role and level. Within the range, individual pay is determined by additional factors, including job-related skills, experience, and relevant education or training. Please note that the compensation details listed in US role postings reflect the base salary only, and do not include equity, or benefits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Discord?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Discord plays a uniquely important role in the future of gaming.

In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day.

At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day.

At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Safeguards Engineering builds and operates the infrastructure that keeps Anthropic&#39;s AI systems safe in production — the classifiers, detection pipelines, evaluation platforms, and monitoring systems that sit between our models and the real world. That infrastructure needs to be not just correct, but &lt;em&gt;reliable&lt;/em&gt;: when a safety-critical pipeline goes down or degrades, the consequences can be serious, and they can be invisible until someone looks closely.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a Technical Program Manager for Safeguards Infrastructure and Evals, you&#39;ll own the operational health and forward momentum of this stack. Your primary responsibility is driving reliability — owning the incident-response and post-mortem process, ensuring SLOs are defined and met in partnership with various teams, and making sure that when things go wrong, the right people know, the right actions get taken, and those actions actually get closed out. Alongside that ongoing operational rhythm, you&#39;ll coordinate the larger platform investments: migrations, eval-platform improvements, and the cross-team dependencies that connect them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This role sits at the intersection of operations and program management. It requires genuine technical depth — you need to understand how these systems work well enough to triage effectively, judge what&#39;s actually safety-critical versus what can wait, and have informed conversations with the engineers building and maintaining them. But the core of the job is keeping the machine running well and the work moving.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What You&#39;ll Do:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Own the Safeguards Engineering ops review - &lt;/strong&gt;Drive the recurring cadence that keeps the team informed and coordinated: surfacing recent incidents and failures, bringing visibility to reliability trends, and making sure the right people are in the room when decisions need to be made. This is the heartbeat of how Safeguards Eng stays ahead of operational risk.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drive incident tracking and post-mortem execution - &lt;/strong&gt;When incidents happen — and in this space, they happen regularly — you&#39;ll make sure they get followed through properly. That means tracking incidents across the organization (including those owned by partner teams like Inference), ensuring post-mortems get written, and most critically, making sure the action items that come out of them actually get done. Closing the loop on post-mortem actions is one of the highest-leverage things this role does.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish and maintain SLOs with partner teams - &lt;/strong&gt;Work with Safeguards Engineering teams and key partners — particularly Inference and Cloud Inference — to define service-level objectives for safety-critical pipelines. Then build the tracking and reporting that makes it possible to tell whether those SLOs are being met, and surface it when they&#39;re not.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintain runbook quality and incident-ownership clarity - &lt;/strong&gt;Safety-critical systems need clear playbooks for when things go wrong.

      "description": "&lt;div class=&quot;content-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Anthropic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Safeguards Engineering builds and operates the infrastructure that keeps Anthropic&#39;s AI systems safe in production — the classifiers, detection pipelines, evaluation platforms, and monitoring systems that sit between our models and the real world. That infrastructure needs to be not just correct, but &lt;em&gt;reliable&lt;/em&gt;: when a safety-critical pipeline goes down or degrades, the consequences can be serious, and they can be invisible until someone looks closely.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a Technical Program Manager for Safeguards Infrastructure and Evals, you&#39;ll own the operational health and forward momentum of this stack. Your primary responsibility is driving reliability — owning the incident-response and post-mortem process, ensuring SLOs are defined and met in partnership with various teams, and making sure that when things go wrong, the right people know, the right actions get taken, and those actions actually get closed out. Alongside that ongoing operational rhythm, you&#39;ll coordinate the larger platform investments: migrations, eval-platform improvements, and the cross-team dependencies that connect them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This role sits at the intersection of operations and program management. It requires genuine technical depth — you need to understand how these systems work well enough to triage effectively, judge what&#39;s actually safety-critical versus what can wait, and have informed conversations with the engineers building and maintaining them. But the core of the job is keeping the machine running well and the work moving.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What You&#39;ll Do:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Own the Safeguards Engineering ops review - &lt;/strong&gt;Drive the recurring cadence that keeps the team informed and coordinated: surfacing recent incidents and failures, bringing visibility to reliability trends, and making sure the right people are in the room when decisions need to be made. This is the heartbeat of how Safeguards Eng stays ahead of operational risk.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drive incident tracking and post-mortem execution - &lt;/strong&gt;When incidents happen — and in this space, they happen regularly — you&#39;ll make sure they get followed through properly. That means tracking incidents across the organization (including those owned by partner teams like Inference), ensuring post-mortems get written, and most critically, making sure the action items that come out of them actually get done. Closing the loop on post-mortem actions is one of the highest-leverage things this role does.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish and maintain SLOs with partner teams - &lt;/strong&gt;Work with Safeguards Engineering teams and key partners — particularly Inference and Cloud Inference — to define service-level objectives for safety-critical pipelines. Then build the tracking and reporting that makes it possible to tell whether those SLOs are being met, and surface it when they&#39;re not.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintain runbook quality and incident-ownership clarity - &lt;/strong&gt;Safety-critical systems need clear playbooks for when things go wrong. Partner with engineering leads to keep runbooks accurate, actionable, and up to date — and ensure that ownership of incidents (including for areas like account-banning false positives and CSAM detection) is unambiguous so that nothing falls through the cracks during an active incident.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drive platform migrations and infrastructure projects - &lt;/strong&gt;Own the program management for the larger infrastructure work on the roadmap: migrating the infra from one platform to the next, moving from one incident platform to the next and from one cloud system monitoring to another, and other migrations as they come.

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 18pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Role:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The U.S. healthcare system wastes hundreds of billions of dollars a year on administrative complexity—the friction between payers, providers, and the systems that connect them. We believe AI can materially reduce that waste, and we’re building the products to do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We’re looking for someone to own this effort. As the product lead for Healthcare, you will be Anthropic’s healthcare leader—setting strategy, shipping products, and serving as the company’s voice in one of the most consequential industries AI will transform. You’ll work across product, engineering, research, go-to-market, policy, and safety to build a healthcare business from early momentum into a scaled vertical.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a 0→1 role. It will be your job to take ownership, sharpen the plan, and drive execution. The scope is broad—healthcare touches nearly every function at the company—and you need to be the kind of person who thrives catching all the balls, triaging what matters, and making sure nothing important falls through the cracks. Low ego, high accountability.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 18pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Own Anthropic’s healthcare strategy end-to-end. You are the DRI, accountable for the plan, the priorities, and the results.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build and ship AI products that address high-value workflows across the payer, provider, and health tech ecosystem. Identify where the biggest pain is, define what to build, and drive it to market.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Be Anthropic’s healthcare leader externally. When a customer, partner, regulator, government agency, or journalist wants to talk to Anthropic about healthcare, you take the meeting. You’re credible, prepared, and trusted.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Triage and coordinate the many cross-functional threads that healthcare creates across the company—product, research, engineering, applied AI, sales, safety, policy, legal, and compliance. Find a home for everything and make sure it moves forward.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Define the product and research roadmap in close partnership with engineering and research teams. You don’t need to lead research day-to-day, but you need sharp instincts about where the model falls short in healthcare contexts and the ability to work with the right teams to close those gaps.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Drive regulatory readiness—including HIPAA compliance—across Anthropic’s products as they serve healthcare customers.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build relationships with strategic customers and partners. Translate what you learn from the market into product priorities, data partnerships, and go-to-market strategy.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 18pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You May Be a Good Fit If:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You’ve spent meaningful time inside the healthcare industry. You’ve worked deeply with payers, providers, or health tech companies and you know how the system actually works: the regulations, the incentives, the operational realities, and where the real inefficiencies live.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You have 10+ years of experience in healthcare, with a significant portion spent close to administrative workflows, revenue cycle, payer operations, or the technology that supports them.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You’ve built products or businesses from scratch (0→1) in complex, regulated environments. You know what it takes to go from ambiguity to a shipped product with real customers.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You have strong cross-functional instincts and genuine willingness to do the work. This role involves as much coordination, follow-through, and unglamorous problem-solving as it does strategy. You are not above any task.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You have strong product judgment and enough technical fluency to engage meaningfully with engineers and researchers on tradeoffs—without needing to be the most technical person in the room. You know when the model isn’t good enough for a given use case and can articulate what “better” looks like.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You communicate exceptionally well. You can translate between the languages of AI capabilities, healthcare operations, regulatory requirements, and business outcomes with equal comfort.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You have experience navigating HIPAA, CMS regulations, or other healthcare compliance frameworks and understand what it takes to ship products in heavily regulated industries.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 18pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Healthcare is one of the largest and most important industries in the world, and it’s on the cusp of a generational technology shift. Anthropic is building the most capable and safety-focused AI in the industry, and this role puts you at the center of bringing that technology to the sector where it can do the most good. You’ll have the autonomy to define strategy, the mandate to ship products, and the backing of a world-class team across research, engineering, and go-to-market.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you’re the kind of person who wants to build something that matters—and has the healthcare expertise and entrepreneurial drive to actually pull it off—we want to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The annual compensation range for this role is listed below.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (&quot;OTE&quot;) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Annual Salary:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-range&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$485,000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;divider&quot;&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;$645,000 USD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logistics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education requirements: &lt;/strong&gt;We require at least a Bachelor&#39;s degree in a related field or equivalent experience.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Location-based hybrid policy:&lt;/strong&gt; Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

You’ve worked deeply with payers, providers, or health tech companies and you know how the system actually works: the regulations, the incentives, the operational realities, and where the real inefficiencies live.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You have 10+ years of experience in healthcare, with a significant portion spent close to administrative workflows, revenue cycle, payer operations, or the technology that supports them.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You’ve built products or businesses from scratch (0→1) in complex, regulated environments. You know what it takes to go from ambiguity to a shipped product with real customers.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You have strong cross-functional instincts and genuine willingness to do the work. This role involves as much coordination, follow-through, and unglamorous problem-solving as it does strategy. You are not above any task.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You have strong product judgment and enough technical fluency to engage meaningfully with engineers and researchers on tradeoffs—without needing to be the most technical person in the room. You know when the model isn’t good enough for a given use case and can articulate what “better” looks like.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You communicate exceptionally well. You can translate between the languages of AI capabilities, healthcare operations, regulatory requirements, and business outcomes with equal comfort.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You have experience navigating HIPAA, CMS regulations, or other healthcare compliance frameworks and understand what it takes to ship products in heavily regulated industries.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 18pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Healthcare is one of the largest and most important industries in the world, and it’s on the cusp of a generational technology shift. Anthropic is building the most capable and safety-focused AI in the industry, and this role puts you at the center of bringing that technology to the sector where it can do the most good. You’ll have the autonomy to define strategy, the mandate to ship products, and the backing of a world-class team across research, engineering, and go-to-market.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you’re the kind of person who wants to build something that matters—and has the healthcare expertise and entrepreneurial drive to actually pull it off—we want to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The annual compensation range for this role is listed below.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (&quot;OTE&quot;) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Annual Salary:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-range&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$485,000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;divider&quot;&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;$645,000 USD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logistics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education requirements: &lt;/strong&gt;We require at least a Bachelor&#39;s degree in a related field or equivalent experience.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Location-based hybrid policy:&lt;/strong&gt; Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time.

At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts.

We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco.

If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

      "job_description": "&lt;p&gt;As the Product Manager for Semantic &amp;amp; Agentic Search, you will own the systems that translate user intent, expressed in natural language, into precise, high-quality interactions across the Datadog platform. This role focuses on enabling users to &lt;em&gt;find, explore, and act&lt;/em&gt; on observability and security data using AI-powered semantic understanding rather than rigid query syntax or navigation paths.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As Datadog continues to expand in breadth and depth, discovering the right data, services, insights, or actions becomes increasingly complex. Semantic search and intent understanding are foundational capabilities that power natural language queries (NLQ), AI-driven navigation, recommendations, and agentic search experiences where systems iteratively refine queries, invoke tools, and adapt based on intermediate results.

      "description": "&lt;p&gt;As the Product Manager for Semantic &amp;amp; Agentic Search, you will own the systems that translate user intent, expressed in natural language, into precise, high-quality interactions across the Datadog platform. This role focuses on enabling users to &lt;em&gt;find, explore, and act&lt;/em&gt; on observability and security data using AI-powered semantic understanding rather than rigid query syntax or navigation paths.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As Datadog continues to expand in breadth and depth, discovering the right data, services, insights, or actions becomes increasingly complex. Semantic search and intent understanding are foundational capabilities that power natural language queries (NLQ), AI-driven navigation, recommendations, and agentic search experiences where systems iteratively refine queries, invoke tools, and adapt based on intermediate results. You will work across logs, metrics, traces, security, notebooks, and platform surfaces to ensure user intent is correctly inferred, disambiguated, and fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is an opportunity to define how millions of engineers interact with Datadog through natural language. Your work will shape the quality, trustworthiness, and usability of AI-driven experiences across the product, directly impacting adoption, engagement, and customer satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;At Datadog, we place value in our office culture - the relationships and collaboration it builds and the creativity it brings to the table.

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are seeking a GRC Automation Lead to join our GRC organization and build the technical foundation for how we scale our risk and compliance programs. In this role, you will lead the team that designs and implements automated workflows, data pipelines, and integrations that transform manual compliance processes into scalable engineering systems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a greenfield opportunity to establish the team, architecture, and integrations that will define how we approach governance, risk, and compliance at Anthropic. The core challenge is a data problem: compliance information lives across dozens of systems—cloud infrastructure, identity providers, HR platforms, ticketing tools, code repositories—and your job is to design systems that bring it together, normalize it, and make it actionable. Success in this role comes from understanding how systems connect and how data flows between them, not from writing code yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At Anthropic, you&#39;ll also have a unique advantage: the ability to design AI-powered workflows where Claude acts as an extension of your team, handling tasks that would traditionally require additional headcount or manual effort. You&#39;ll need ingenuity to identify where agentic AI can accelerate evidence collection, interpret unstructured data, triage compliance gaps, and augment human judgment in risk assessments. Working closely with Security, IT, and Engineering teams, you&#39;ll translate compliance and regulatory requirements into solutions that support audit programs including SOC 2, ISO, HIPAA, and FedRAMP, building systems that combine traditional automation with AI capabilities to achieve scale that wouldn&#39;t otherwise be possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Responsibilities:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Lead the team that establishes foundational GRC processes and architecture. Design and build automated workflows for risk management and compliance, creating scalable systems that enable continuous monitoring as Anthropic grows.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build data pipelines that aggregate risk, control, and asset information from across our technology stack. This means solving hard data integration problems: mapping disparate schemas, handling inconsistent data quality, and creating unified views of compliance posture through dashboards and reporting tools.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Inform GRC platform strategy and implementation: in partnership with other programs, evaluate, select, and deploy tooling that meets our compliance requirements.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Translate written policies and compliance requirements into policy-as-code—working with Engineering and Security teams to express requirements as enforceable rules, automated checks, and continuous validation rather than static documents.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Establish feedback loops between policy and implementation: surface where technical controls diverge from written requirements, identify where policies need to evolve based on infrastructure realities, and ensure that compliance requirements are expressed in terms engineers can act on.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Design and deploy agentic AI workflows that extend team capacity, using Claude to automate evidence analysis, monitor control effectiveness, draft audit responses, interpret policy documents, and handle other tasks that require reasoning over unstructured information.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Design and maintain integrations connecting GRC tooling with cloud infrastructure, identity management systems, HRIS platforms, ticketing systems, version control, and CI/CD pipelines—working with engineers to implement integrations that enable automated evidence collection and continuous compliance validation.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build and lead the GRC Automation function as we scale: hiring team members, establishing practices, and defining the technical roadmap for governance and compliance automation at Anthropic.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;You may be a good fit if you:&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have 3-4+ years of experience managing technical individual contributors or systems-focused teams, with a proven track record of building or scaling small teams (2-5 people) in security, compliance, automation, or operations functions.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are a systems thinker first. You understand how complex environments work: how data flows between systems, where integration points exist, what breaks when systems don&#39;t talk to each other. Your strength is designing the right architecture and environment for security monitoring, not necessarily implementing it yourself.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have 5+ years of experience designing automated workflows, data pipelines, or system integrations, whether through traditional development, low-code platforms, GRC tools, or process automation. We care about your ability to solve integration problems, not your programming language proficiency.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have a relentless focus on data integration: you understand how to pull data from multiple sources, normalize it, join it meaningfully, and surface insights. You&#39;re comfortable reasoning about messy, inconsistent data and designing systems that handle edge cases gracefully.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Understand APIs and integration patterns conceptually: REST APIs, webhooks, authentication flows, polling vs. push architectures, and can evaluate systems based on how well they expose data and support automation, even if you&#39;re not writing the integration code yourself.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Can work independently with minimal guidance, taking ownership of complex problems from design through implementation while managing ambiguity inherent in early-stage programs.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have strong analytical and problem-solving skills with attention to detail necessary for compliance work, balanced with pragmatism about risk-based prioritization in fast-paced environments.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Strong candidates may have:&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience designing or implementing AI-powered automation, agentic workflows, or LLM-based tooling in operational contexts.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience with GRC platforms such as ServiceNow GRC, Vanta, Drata, OneTrust, RSA Archer, or similar tools including configuration, customization, and integration capabilities&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with scripting languages (Python or similar) for automation tasks, API interactions, and data transformation.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Prior experience in high-growth startup environments demonstrating ability to build scalable processes and adapt quickly to changing requirements and priorities&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with Infrastructure as Code tools (Terraform, CloudFormation, Ansible) and DevSecOps practices including CI/CD pipeline integration and policy-as-code implementations.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure) and an understanding of how compliance-relevant data can be extracted from their APIs and logging systems.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deadline to apply:&lt;/strong&gt; None, applications will be received on a rolling basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The annual compensation range for this role is listed below.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (&quot;OTE&quot;) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Annual Salary:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-range&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$345,000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;divider&quot;&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;$345,000 USD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logistics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education requirements: &lt;/strong&gt;We require at least a Bachelor&#39;s degree in a related field or equivalent experience.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Location-based hybrid policy:&lt;/strong&gt; Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time.

However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day.

At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco.

Design and build automated workflows for risk management and compliance, creating scalable systems that enable continuous monitoring as Anthropic grows.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build data pipelines that aggregate risk, control, and asset information from across our technology stack. This means solving hard data integration problems: mapping disparate schemas, handling inconsistent data quality, and creating unified views of compliance posture through dashboards and reporting tools.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Inform GRC platform strategy and implementation: in partnership with other programs, evaluate, select, and deploy tooling that meets our compliance requirements.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Translate written policies and compliance requirements into policy-as-code—working with Engineering and Security teams to express requirements as enforceable rules, automated checks, and continuous validation rather than static documents.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Establish feedback loops between policy and implementation: surface where technical controls diverge from written requirements, identify where policies need to evolve based on infrastructure realities, and ensure that compliance requirements are expressed in terms engineers can act on.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Design and deploy agentic AI workflows that extend team capacity, using Claude to automate evidence analysis, monitor control effectiveness, draft audit responses, interpret policy documents, and handle other tasks that require reasoning over unstructured information.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Design and maintain integrations connecting GRC tooling with cloud infrastructure, identity management systems, HRIS platforms, ticketing systems, version control, and CI/CD pipelines—working with engineers to implement integrations that enable automated evidence collection and continuous compliance validation.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build and lead the GRC Automation function as we scale: hiring team members, establishing practices, and defining the technical roadmap for governance and compliance automation at Anthropic.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;You may be a good fit if you:&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have 3-4+ years of experience managing technical individual contributors or systems-focused teams, with a proven track record of building or scaling small teams (2-5 people) in security, compliance, automation, or operations functions.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are a systems thinker first. You understand how complex environments work: how data flows between systems, where integration points exist, what breaks when systems don&#39;t talk to each other. Your strength is designing the right architecture and environment for security monitoring, not necessarily implementing it yourself.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have 5+ years of experience designing automated workflows, data pipelines, or system integrations, whether through traditional development, low-code platforms, GRC tools, or process automation. We care about your ability to solve integration problems, not your programming language proficiency.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have a relentless focus on data integration: you understand how to pull data from multiple sources, normalize it, join it meaningfully, and surface insights. You&#39;re comfortable reasoning about messy, inconsistent data and designing systems that handle edge cases gracefully.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Understand APIs and integration patterns conceptually: REST APIs, webhooks, authentication flows, polling vs. push architectures, and can evaluate systems based on how well they expose data and support automation, even if you&#39;re not writing the integration code yourself.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Can work independently with minimal guidance, taking ownership of complex problems from design through implementation while managing ambiguity inherent in early-stage programs.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have strong analytical and problem-solving skills with attention to detail necessary for compliance work, balanced with pragmatism about risk-based prioritization in fast-paced environments.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Strong candidates may have:&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience designing or implementing AI-powered automation, agentic workflows, or LLM-based tooling in operational contexts.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience with GRC platforms such as ServiceNow GRC, Vanta, Drata, OneTrust, RSA Archer, or similar tools including configuration, customization, and integration capabilities&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with scripting languages (Python or similar) for automation tasks, API interactions, and data transformation.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Prior experience in high-growth startup environments demonstrating ability to build scalable processes and adapt quickly to changing requirements and priorities&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with Infrastructure as Code tools (Terraform, CloudFormation, Ansible) and DevSecOps practices including CI/CD pipeline integration and policy-as-code implementations.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure) and an understanding of how compliance-relevant data can be extracted from their APIs and logging systems.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deadline to apply:&lt;/strong&gt; None, applications will be received on a rolling basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The annual compensation range for this role is listed below.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (&quot;OTE&quot;) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Annual Salary:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-range&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$345,000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;divider&quot;&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;$345,000 USD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logistics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education requirements: &lt;/strong&gt;We require at least a Bachelor&#39;s degree in a related field or equivalent experience.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Location-based hybrid policy:&lt;/strong&gt; Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time.

However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day.

At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

that resonate with technical and business stakeholders alike.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is an ideal opportunity for someone who thrives at the intersection of strategic thinking and hands-on execution, and who is energized by the challenge of bringing frontier AI technology to an industry where trust, compliance, and reliability are non-negotiable.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;Responsibilities:&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Develop and own the marketing strategy for the Financial Services &amp;amp; Insurance segment, including positioning, messaging, campaign planning, and go-to-market coordination in close partnership with Sales&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Create and execute integrated marketing programs — spanning digital, content, events, and partner channels — designed to generate pipeline and accelerate the sales cycle for enterprise prospects in this vertical&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Build a deep understanding of the competitive landscape, buyer personas, and AI adoption patterns specific to financial services and insurance, and translate those insights into actionable marketing strategies&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Develop segment-specific content including case studies, solution guides, thought leadership pieces, and enablement materials that speak to the priorities and pain points of this industry&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Collaborate cross-functionally with product, sales, communications, design, and research teams to ensure marketing efforts are aligned with product capabilities and business objectives&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Design and implement ABM campaigns for top strategic accounts&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Manage relationships with industry analysts, event organizers, and strategic partners to expand Anthropic&#39;s reach and credibility within the segment&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Define and track key performance metrics for segment marketing programs, using data to continuously optimize campaigns and report on impact to leadership&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Stay current with regulatory developments, industry trends, and evolving AI adoption dynamics in financial services to inform marketing positioning and content strategy&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;You may be a good fit if you:&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Have 7+ years of experience in B2B marketing, with a focus on enterprise technology or SaaS, and demonstrated expertise in one or more verticals within financial services or insurance&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Have a strong track record of developing and executing integrated marketing programs that have measurably driven pipeline and revenue in complex, enterprise sales cycles&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Understand the decision-making dynamics, regulatory considerations, and technology evaluation processes that are common in financial services organizations&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Are skilled at translating complex technical capabilities into compelling, audience-specific narratives — particularly for both technical and business stakeholders&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Have experience collaborating closely with enterprise sales teams to align marketing strategy with deal-stage needs and pipeline goals&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Are comfortable with ambiguity and can balance long-term strategic planning with rapid, tactical execution in a fast-moving environment&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Are a strong communicator who can present clearly to leadership, cross-functional partners, and external audiences&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Care about ensuring that AI systems are developed safely and responsibly, and are excited about communicating that story to a sophisticated audience&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;Strong candidates may also have:&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Experience marketing AI or machine learning products to regulated industries&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Familiarity with the specific compliance and risk management frameworks relevant to financial services (e.g., SOC 2, SOX, banking regulations)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Background in analyst relations or thought leadership programs within the financial services technology space&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Experience working at a high-growth technology company navigating rapid expansion into new verticals&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A

Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole.

Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

      "description": "&lt;div class=&quot;content-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discord is used by over 200 million people every month for many different reasons, but there’s one thing that nearly everyone does on our platform:&lt;strong&gt; play video games.&lt;/strong&gt; Over 90% of our users play games, spending a combined 1.5 billion hours playing thousands of unique titles on Discord each month. Discord plays a uniquely important role in the future of gaming. We are focused on making it easier and more fun for people to talk and hang out before, during, and after playing games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discord&#39;s Product Policy team shapes how millions of people play games and hang out with their friends. The Safety Policy team sits at the heart of this mission, developing the content and product policies that protect users while preserving what makes Discord special: a place built for gaming where friends can talk, play, and have fun together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We&#39;re looking for a Director of Safety Policy to lead policy development for Discord&#39;s consumer products and experiences. This isn&#39;t your typical policy role. You&#39;ll combine deep policy expertise with cutting-edge ML/AI approaches, using LLMs to develop, test, and iterate on policies that work at Discord&#39;s scale. You&#39;ll work at the intersection of user safety, product innovation, and operational excellence, ensuring our policies are both principled and pragmatic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this role, you&#39;ll lead a team responsible for developing Community Guidelines, recommendations policies, and the policy frameworks that shape user experiences across Discord&#39;s consumer products. You&#39;ll partner with Trust &amp;amp; Safety Operations, Engineering, Legal, Product, and cross-functional teams to ensure policies can be enforced consistently and effectively. And because Discord operates under rapidly evolving regulations globally, you&#39;ll need to translate complex regulatory requirements into policies that actually work for our platform and our users.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This role reports to the Senior Director of Product Policy and is based in San Francisco or available remotely within the United States.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you&#39;ll be doing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lead Policy Development: &lt;/strong&gt;Own the creation, iteration, and maintenance of Discord&#39;s core safety policies, including Community Guidelines and recommendations policies. Develop policy frameworks that balance user safety, freedom of expression, and operational feasibility while reflecting Discord&#39;s unique identity as a communications platform purpose-built for people who play games with their friends.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leverage ML &amp;amp; AI for Policy Innovation: &lt;/strong&gt;Use LLMs and other AI technologies to develop, test, and iterate on policy language, enforcement criteria, and operational workflows. Build scalable approaches to policy development that combine human expertise with machine intelligence. Experiment with novel approaches to policy creation.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build and Lead a High-Performing Team: &lt;/strong&gt;Manage, mentor, and grow a team of policy experts who are passionate about user safety and platform integrity. Foster a culture of rigorous thinking, creative problem-solving, and continuous learning. Develop future leaders who can navigate complex policy challenges with both empathy and analytical precision.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bridge Policy and Operations: &lt;/strong&gt;Partner with Trust &amp;amp; Safety teams to ensure policies can be enforced consistently at scale. Co-create enforcement guidance, standard operating procedures, and training materials. Build feedback loops that help policy evolve based on operational reality and emerging harms.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Navigate the Regulatory Landscape: &lt;/strong&gt;Translate requirements from global regulations (DSA, Online Safety Act, platform-specific legislation) into actionable policy frameworks. Work with Legal and Platform Compliance teams to ensure Discord&#39;s policies meet regulatory obligations while preserving user experience. Anticipate regulatory trends and proactively position Discord&#39;s policy approach for future requirements.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support Product Teams: &lt;/strong&gt;Advise product teams on safety risks and policy implications for new features and experiences. Develop frameworks for responsible product development that help teams move quickly while building safety in from the start.&amp;nbsp;Provide clear guidance on policy boundaries and escalation paths for edge cases.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drive Thought Leadership: &lt;/strong&gt;Represent Discord&#39;s policy approach externally through industry forums, academic partnerships, press, and civil society engagement. Contribute to advancing industry best practices in content moderation and platform governance. Build Discord&#39;s reputation as a leader in thoughtful, evidence-based policy development.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you should have&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10+ years of experience&lt;/strong&gt; in trust &amp;amp; safety policy development, content moderation, or platform governance at a global technology company, with demonstrated progression to leadership roles&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Team management experience: &lt;/strong&gt;3+ years leading policy teams of 5+ people, with proven ability to hire, develop, and retain top talent in a fast-paced environment&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regulatory expertise: &lt;/strong&gt;Direct experience developing policies in response to platform regulations (DSA, UK Online Safety Act, Take it Down Act, or similar frameworks). Deep understanding of how regulatory requirements translate into operational reality.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ML for content moderation: &lt;/strong&gt;Hands-on experience using machine learning systems for content moderation, policy enforcement, or risk assessment.

Our teams develop AI agents that don’t just surface insights—they take action, optimizing spend, managing workflows, and making real-time decisions on behalf of our customers. By deeply integrating proprietary financial data with product and platform infrastructure, we’re turning complex financial operations into simple, automated experiences and setting a new standard for how modern finance works.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you’ll do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You’ll be the senior technical owner of the Brex Assistant: a consumer-facing conversation product and will lead the rollout of the Assistant experience — defining what “great” looks like, sequencing capabilities deliberately, and shipping a product that is reliable, opinionated, and genuinely useful. You’ll write a significant amount of production code, set the quality bar, and shape how agentic systems integrate with Brex’s core workflows.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a deeply product-driven role. Success is measured by better outcomes for customers — higher-quality expense documentation, stronger policy compliance, and less time spent clicking around Brex.com — not by novelty or research output.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where you’ll work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This role will be based in our Seattle office. We are a hybrid environment that combines the energy and connections of being in the office with the benefits and flexibility of working from home. We currently require a minimum of two coordinated days in the office per week, Wednesday and Thursday. Starting February 2, 2026, we will require three days per week in office - Monday, Wednesday and Thursday. As a perk, we also have up to four weeks per year of fully remote work!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Own the end-to-end conversational experience for the Brex Assistant, including both outbound system-initiated interactions and inbound mobile chat.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Act as the technical and product bar-setter for the team, making and executing hard sequencing decisions for assistant capabilities (e.g., memory, merchant data, preferences).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Write high-quality, production-grade code while shaping architecture and interfaces for agentic workflows, partnering closely with Spend/Expense teams to influence core Brex workflows.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Set and enforce a high bar for reliability, correctness, and UX in a non-deterministic system, collaborating with infrastructure and security teams for deep integration.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Establish team norms and best practices for building agentic products, focusing on overcommunication, validation, and quality control.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requirements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Proven experience building and owning user-facing software products in complex, real-world domains.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Established experience as a Staff / Senior Staff engineer or hands-on Tech Lead; prior people management experience is a strong plus.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Strong product judgment: a track record of making hard tradeoffs, sticking to them, and delivering outcomes under real constraints.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience building systems that must be reliable despite messy inputs — whether from users, non-deterministic systems, or both.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ability to independently own UX and roadmap decisions, build simple and robust user-centric software, and mentor junior engineers through strong product and technical guidance.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus points&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience working on consumer or prosumer products in regulated or high-stakes domains (finance, healthcare, travel, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Direct experience with conversational UX, agents, or other non-deterministic systems in production.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Personal empathy for spend-heavy workflows (frequent travel, recruiting, managing expenses on behalf of a company).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compensation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The expected salary range for this role is $192,000 - $240,000.

We help companies spend with confidence with integrated corporate cards, banking, and global payments, plus intuitive software for travel and expenses. Tens of thousands of companies from startups to enterprises — including DoorDash, Flexport, and Compass — use Brex to proactively control spend, reduce costs, and increase efficiency on a global scale.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Working at Brex allows you to push your limits, challenge the status quo, and collaborate with some of the brightest minds in the industry. We’re committed to building a diverse team and inclusive culture and believe your potential should only be limited by how big you can dream. We make this a reality by empowering you with the tools, resources, and support you need to grow your career.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Marketing at Brex&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Marketing team tells the Brex story, determines messaging and positioning, and translates our products and features into tangible customer benefits.

You genuinely love startups and follow the ecosystem closely.

At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco.

However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day.

At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",
