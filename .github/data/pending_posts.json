The anticipated start date is February 1, 2026, or shortly thereafter. The postdoctoral fellow will conduct both laboratory- and field-based investigations aimed at advancing mine-tailings-derived construction materials. After identifying tailings sites of interest in Peru, the researcher will oversee sample collection and perform comprehensive physical, chemical, and mineralogical characterization. These results will form the basis for a systematic assessment of reuse pathways. The project will evaluate four primary reuse options for sulfidic mine tailings: (1) use as lightweight aggregates in concrete, (2) utilization as a supplementary cementitious material in concrete, and (3) application as a precursor in alkali-activated or geopolymer materials. The postdoctoral fellow will contribute to the evaluation of these pathways in collaboration with the project team. Additional responsibilities include preparing project reports, scholarly publications, and research proposals. The role also involves close collaboration with research partners in Peru, and the fellow may be required to travel and conduct on-site work to support key project activities.PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITIESConducting laboratory and field studies aimed at production of construction materials from mine tailingsPrepare research manuscripts and technical reportsAssist with mentoring of graduate and undergraduate students and training of research collaboratorsAssist with preparing research proposals resulting from the conducted research Minimum QualificationsEducation and Experience:A PhD in a related field (civil engineering, materials engineering, geological engineering, mining engineering, chemical engineering, physics, chemistry, or other related fields).Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities:Strong publication record in high quality peer-reviewed journalsExcellent communication skills, both oral and writtenCurrently in the US with current work authorizationPreferred:Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities:Ability to communicate fluently in SpanishAbility to travel to PeruPrior experience with one or more of the following: cement testing, concrete performance evaluation and durability testing, materials characterization using equipment such as SEM, XRD, XRF, SEM-EDS, ICP-AES, FTIR, TGA, Micro-CT.About Mines & Golden, CO When the world looks for answers, the world looks to Mines. Colorado School of Mines is a top-ranked public university solving the grand challenges facing our society, particularly those related to the Earth, energy and the environment. Founded in 1874 with specialties in mining and metallurgy, Mines’ scope and mission have continually expanded to meet the needs of industry and society.
