Melzi, named after Leonardo Da Vinci’s favorite student, was designed with our very own unique needs and priorities in mind. Since launching, our traders have been very excited to work with this custom-made and highly efficient system. Process: Coding challenge: This take-home assessment will give you a chance to understand the role further through similar tasks to the ones you’ll encounter on our trading floor. It allows us to assess your coding skills, as well as your approach to problem solving. HR Interview: In this conversation with one of our recruiters, you will learn more about Da Vinci and give us the opportunity to get to know you better. We will assess whether your soft skills and motivators fit our way of working. Technical Interview: During this conversation with one of our lead engineers you will get to geek out on your knowledge of computer science and C++ programming.

Our group includes hard-working Systems Engineers, Administrators and Programmers, tasked with maintaining and improving the platform that powers Jane Street's production trading systems. Our mix of in-house and open source software allows you to investigate and innovate at every level. On any given day, you could be debugging kernel performance, developing management tools, or resolving production issues in real time. Diving into tricky systems problems is our specialty. Deployment automation, scalable configuration management, and obsessive monitoring are the focus of some of our ongoing projects. We automate as much of our work as we can, but not because we’re lazy. We find that automation reduces our error rate and overall workload - plus, we think it's fun. Working in our group provides opportunities for involvement with almost every other facet of the company. We work directly with colleagues in trading, technology, and operations to build and maintain systems with a firm-wide scope. Using feedback from other groups and our custom monitoring tools, we strive to resolve production issues quickly, perform comprehensive root-cause analyses, and integrate long-term fixes in a clean and robust way. We don't expect you to come in with deep experience - we're happy to hire smart problem solvers and teach them what they need to know. You’ll train alongside our more seasoned team members in a hands-on capacity, learning how we make tangible and immediate improvements to our infrastructure every day.
