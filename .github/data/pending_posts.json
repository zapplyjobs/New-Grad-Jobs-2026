Your mission is to keep production sites running smoothly, resolve complex software issues before they disrupt performance, and feed insights back to Engineering for continuous improvement. You’ll dive deep into logs, Data driven results , and configuration states; craft work-arounds or scripted patches; and collaborate closely with the Technical Assistance Center (Tier 1), Product Support (hardware), and Engineering (Tier 3). This role is ideal for engineers who love debugging live systems, explaining technical details to non-experts, and shipping pragmatic fixes fast—all while laying the groundwork for a future move into Hardware or Software Engineering. This role requires a combination of field readiness, software debugging, data analysis, and direct collaboration with internal engineering and customer-facing teams.Physical & Work EnvironmentLocation: Redwood City, CA. Office desk-based tasks and lab-floor testing.This position requires extended deployment to customer locations, with up to 80% of time spent stationed on-site.

Knowledge & Automation — Write SOPs, runbooks, and self-service articles; contribute to CLI tools and diagnostic scripts in Python/Bash; mentor TAC on new failure modes.Continuous Improvement Projects — Partner with Product and Application Engineering on feature hardening, performance tuning, and reliability improvement.

Clear Communication — translate technical findings into customer-friendly language and crisp bug reports.Self-starter mindset with a willingness to take ownership in ambiguous environments.Bias for Action — sense of urgency in production environments; willingness to “own the ticket” until closure.Nice-to-Have, Role-Specific StrengthsExperience supporting AI/ML inference platforms (model drift, retraining pipelines).Familiarity with message queues & real-time data buses ( RESTAPI).Exposure to industrial automation or warehouse management systems.Knowledge of CI/CD workflows (GitHub Actions, ArgoCD) and feature-flag rollouts.Basic understanding of robot kinematics and perception pipelines to converse with Product Support colleagues.QualificationsBachelor’s degree in an engineering discipline (e.g., Mechanical, Electrical, Industrial, Robotics) or Computer Science — with demonstrable coding skills and a solid grounding in computer-science fundamentals.
