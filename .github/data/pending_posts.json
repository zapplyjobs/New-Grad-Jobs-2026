      "job_description": "ABOUT SUPABASE\n\nSupabase is the Postgres development platform, built by developers for developers. We provide a complete backend solution including Database, Auth, Storage, Edge Functions, Realtime, and Vector Search. All services are deeply integrated and designed for growth.\n\n\nAbout the role\nWe're looking for a Rust Developer to join our team to help innovate on our PostgreSQL projects.\n\nYou'll primarily collaborate with the PostgreSQL tools team and directly contribute to technical choices and internal processes.\n\nThe key tasks associated with this role revolve around Rust development in the PostgreSQL ecosystem. You will work to refine https://github.com/supabase/etl expand our PostgreSQL extensions, develop CLI tooling for the dbdev package index, and assist in the development of several other repositories.\n\nIn this role, you will be mainly responsible for:\n\n - contributing to our Rust repos:\n   \n   - Public Projects https://github.com/supabase/pg_replicate, wrappers https://github.com/supabase/wrappers, pg_graphql https://github.com/supabase/pg_graphql, dbdev https://github.com/supabase/dbdev, pg_jsonschema https://github.com/supabase/pg_jsonschema,\n\n - participating in the successful rollout of pl/rust https://github.com/tcdi/plrust\n\n\nTHIS ROLE REQUIRES FIVE CRITICAL ATTRIBUTES:\n\n 1. You have a strong background in Rust programming. You're well-versed in Rust's unique features and understand how to leverage them to create efficient, reliable software. You are comfortable making architectural decisions and navigating/contributing to large codebases.\n\n 2. Experience with system design and infrastructure: understanding of cloud environments, some knowledge of k8s.\n\n 3. Experience with PostgreSQL. While not strictly necessary, experience with PostgreSQL will be a significant advantage in this role. You may have previously worked with PostgreSQL extensions or used PostgreSQL in a high-performance context.\n\n 4. Ability to self-manage. Every company will expect you to self-manage to some degree, but Supabase takes this to a new level. We are a flat, early-stage startup without a lot of structure.

      "description": "ABOUT SUPABASE\n\nSupabase is the Postgres development platform, built by developers for developers. We provide a complete backend solution including Database, Auth, Storage, Edge Functions, Realtime, and Vector Search. All services are deeply integrated and designed for growth.\n\n\nAbout the role\nWe're looking for a Rust Developer to join our team to help innovate on our PostgreSQL projects.\n\nYou'll primarily collaborate with the PostgreSQL tools team and directly contribute to technical choices and internal processes.\n\nThe key tasks associated with this role revolve around Rust development in the PostgreSQL ecosystem. You will work to refine https://github.com/supabase/etl expand our PostgreSQL extensions, develop CLI tooling for the dbdev package index, and assist in the development of several other repositories.\n\nIn this role, you will be mainly responsible for:\n\n - contributing to our Rust repos:\n   \n   - Public Projects https://github.com/supabase/pg_replicate, wrappers https://github.com/supabase/wrappers, pg_graphql https://github.com/supabase/pg_graphql, dbdev https://github.com/supabase/dbdev, pg_jsonschema https://github.com/supabase/pg_jsonschema,\n\n - participating in the successful rollout of pl/rust https://github.com/tcdi/plrust\n\n\nTHIS ROLE REQUIRES FIVE CRITICAL ATTRIBUTES:\n\n 1. You have a strong background in Rust programming. You're well-versed in Rust's unique features and understand how to leverage them to create efficient, reliable software. You are comfortable making architectural decisions and navigating/contributing to large codebases.\n\n 2. Experience with system design and infrastructure: understanding of cloud environments, some knowledge of k8s.\n\n 3. Experience with PostgreSQL. While not strictly necessary, experience with PostgreSQL will be a significant advantage in this role. You may have previously worked with PostgreSQL extensions or used PostgreSQL in a high-performance context.\n\n 4. Ability to self-manage. Every company will expect you to self-manage to some degree, but Supabase takes this to a new level. We are a flat, early-stage startup without a lot of structure. To thrive in this environment, you’ll need to be a motivated self-starter who is good working asynchronously across multiple teams. We’re looking for someone who will identify things that need improvement and put their heads down until it’s shipped.\n\n 5.

We aim to make developers more effective by allowing them to ship their code without any fuss — write your code, push it to us, and we deliver it to your end-users. We’re the Railway that takes your code from A to Z in a straight line: no transfers, no mad scrambling for boarding, no chaos in your journey.\n\nThis is a hybrid user-facing role with some full-stack engineering elements.

Be the voice of the customer, aggregating their passionate concerns into actionable product outcomes.\n\n 2. Translate customer reports into actionable insights, surface patterns from individual issues, and ensure critical problems reach the right team with proper context.\n\n 3. Create written content for internal and external audiences by writing documentation, runbooks, and customer communications that make infrastructure feel approachable.\n\n 4. Understand the technical landscape our users are coming from and the relief they feel when Railway just works.\n\n\nABOUT YOU\n\n 1. Native proficiency in English language. Effective writing and communication skills with a personable nature; able to distill difficult technical concepts to a wide range of users\n\n 2. An understanding that behind every deployment failure is a customer’s stress level spiking, and you can navigate both the technical debugging and the human reassurance needed to make things right\n\n 3. An understanding of containers, deployment pipelines, databases, and cloud services well enough to quickly diagnose issues and guide users to solutions.\n\n 4. Deployed apps, wrestled with databases, and debugged mysterious failures. You know enough to speak the same language as our users and diagnose where things went sideways.\n\n 5. A mindset for pattern recognition. See three similar tickets and immediately start connecting dots. Is this a UI confusion? A missing feature? A bug that only happens on Tuesdays? You're constantly surfacing insights that help us fix problems at their root.\n\n 6. The ability to remain the calm expert who makes problems feel solvable; you can context-switch between five different crisis modes while keeping each customer feeling like they're your only priority.\n\nThis role, in our opinion, is perfect for folks who have done tours in Technical Support, Developer Advocacy, or Engineering roles where you worked closely with users.\n\nWe don’t require you to check every box on the list, and we generally prefer working with people that are hungry for knowledge in areas they feel they’re lacking in. Please don’t hesitate to shoot us an application if you find Railway and the role interesting!\n\nWe value and love to work with diverse persons from all backgrounds\n\nThings to know\n\nFor better or worse, we're a startup; our team dynamics are different from companies of different sizes and stages.\n\n - We're distributed ALL across the globe, and that's only going to be more and more distributed. As a result, stuff is ALWAYS happening.\n\n - We do NOT expect you to work all the time, but you'll have to be diligent about your boundaries because the end of your day may overlap with the start of someone else's.\n\n - We're a small team, with high ownership, who are not only passionate about what we do, but seek to be exceptional as well. At the time of writing we're 21, serving hundreds of thousands of users. There's a lot of stuff going on, and a lot of ambiguity.\n\n - We want you to own it. We believe that ownership is a key to growth, and part of that growth is not only being able to make the choices, but owning the success, or failure, that comes with those choices.\n\nBenefits and perks\n\nAt Railway, we provide best in class benefits.

Just a Monday and a Friday to go over the Company Board. We think your time is sacred, whether it's at work, or outside of work.\n\n - Ownership: We're a company with a high ownership, high autonomy culture. We hope that you'll come in, help us, and over the course of many years do the best work of your life. When we bring you onboard, we expect you to change the company.\n\n - Novel problems/solutions: We're a startup that's well funded, with cool problems, which lets us implement novel solutions!

Discord plays a uniquely important role in the future of gaming. We are focused on making it easier and more fun for people to talk and hang out before, during, and after playing games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discord’s Trust &amp;amp; Safety team is responsible for protecting users and maintaining platform integrity by detecting, investigating, preventing, and responding to harmful content, abusive behavior, and policy violations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are seeking an experienced Senior Director of Threat Operations (Trust &amp;amp; Safety) to lead a team responsible for policy enforcement and threat disruption, detecting, analyzing, and preventing serious threats to Discord and its users. The organization includes teams focused on high harm areas (counter-extremism, cybercrime, minor safety, self-harm, and exploitative content and behavior), and cross-functional safety initiatives. As Discord grows, you&#39;ll grow this function, both by designing better ways to get the work done, and by supporting a team of motivated experts. Reporting to our VP, Trust &amp;amp; Safety, you&#39;ll champion your team of operations and safety experts to identify, remove, and prevent threats to Discord and its users (including violations of our Community Guidelines), partner with product and engineering to integrate and develop new tools, work with internal teams to implement operational procedures, act as the front line for escalations from users and internal teams, and represent our overall Trust &amp;amp; Safety efforts. You&#39;re an experienced and dynamic senior leader responsible for developing and executing strategies to ensure platform integrity and user safety while developing an empowered and healthy team.

Our goal is to make developers orders of magnitude more efficient by becoming the operating system for modern development.\n\nBy building tooling for infrastructure automation, we seek to make people 100x more effective, and build 100x more impactful systems. Building leverage is a core part of what we do.\n\nWe’re seeking a versatile and seasoned Product Designer who strives to create great products, loves collaborating, and takes the initiative. The ideal candidate will derive satisfaction from ideating, designing, and delivering exceptional solutions to hundreds of thousands of developers. This position is tailored for a well-rounded professional who appreciates the art of creative thinking but places equal importance on witnessing their ideas come to life.\n\n“Products are made in a factory but brands are created in the mind.” - Walter Landor\n\nWant to learn about our work culture? Here is a three-part blog series that will help you see the unique ways our team works (Parts 1 https://blog.railway.app/p/how-we-work, 2 https://blog.railway.app/p/how-we-work-volume-ii, 3 https://blog.railway.app/p/how-we-work-volume-iii, and 4 https://blog.railway.com/p/how-we-work-volume-iv)\n\nAbout the role\n\n - Play a pivotal role in Railway's developer experience, redefining the future of software infrastructure.\n\n - Collaborate closely with product, support, and engineering to scope, define, design, and ship high-quality features.\n\n - Contribute to the overall design direction of the product, leveraging your creativity and problem-solving skills to address complex design challenges and deliver elegant solutions.\n\n - Balance user needs, business goals, and technical constraints of design solutions, ensuring that Railway remains user-friendly, scalable, and reliable.\n\n - Define workflows, prototypes, and visual design of your projects.\n\n - Learn about our users, how they use our platform, understand their pain points, and propose projects to fix them.\n\n - Help us maintain and evolve our internal Design System\n\n - Work in an ambiguous environment to create levers for design excellence, using process sparingly but effectively.\n\n - Contribute to the design culture within the company.\n\nAbout you\n\n - You have a strong portfolio showcasing your skills in user interface design, interaction design, and visual design. Your portfolio demonstrates your ability to solve complex design problems and showcases your attention to detail.\n\n - You care about creating good products, understand what makes a good experience, and constantly think of improvement opportunities for the products you use.\n\n - You care about business needs, implications, and the practicality of your solutions and work to deliver clear, intuitive, and appealing human interfaces.\n\n - You are a creative thinker who can push the boundaries of design while ensuring a balance between user needs, business goals, and technical constraints.\n\n - You feel comfortable designing, illustrating, iterating, and prototyping in Figma, but always look for new tools to open new possibilities (Blender, Spline, Rive, shaders, etc.).\n\n - You have experience balancing trade-offs while implementing a feature to ship it on time without compromising the long-term product vision.\n\n - You have experience effectively collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality designs within project timelines.\n\n - You have excellent communication skills and can articulate design decisions and rationale effectively to stakeholders and team members.\n\nWe value and love to work with diverse persons from all backgrounds\n\nThings to know\n\nFor better or worse, we're a startup; our team dynamics are different from companies of different sizes and stages.\n\n - We're distributed ALL across the globe, and that's only going to be more and more distributed. As a result, stuff is ALWAYS happening.\n\n - We do NOT expect you to work all the time, but you'll have to be diligent about your boundaries because the end of your day may overlap with the start of someone else's.\n\n - We're a small team, with high ownership, who are not only passionate about what we do, but seek to be exceptional as well. At the time of writing we're 21, serving hundreds of thousands of users. There's a lot of stuff going on, and a lot of ambiguity.\n\n - We want you to own it. We believe that ownership is a key to growth, and part of that growth is not only being able to make the choices, but owning the success, or failure, that comes with those choices.\n\nBenefits and perks\n\nAt Railway, we provide best in class benefits. Great salary, full health benefits including dependents, strong equity grants, equipment stipend, and much more. For more details, check back on the main careers page https://railway.app/careers/Product-designer.\n\nBeyond compensation, there are a few things that we believe that make working at Railway truly unique:\n\n - Autonomy: We have very few meetings. Just a Monday and a Friday to go over the Company Board. We think your time is sacred, whether it's at work, or outside of work.\n\n - Ownership: We're a company with a high ownership, high autonomy culture. We hope that you'll come in, help us, and over the course of many years do the best work of your life. When we bring you onboard, we expect you to change the company.\n\n - Novel problems/solutions: We're a startup that's well funded, with cool problems, which lets us implement novel solutions! We abhor “busywork” and think, whether it's community, engineering, operations, etc there's always opportunity for creative and high leverage solutions.\n\n - Growth: We want you to grow with us, but we know that talent is loaned, so when you figure out what area you want to grow in next, whether it's at Railway or outside, we'll make sure you land there.\n\nHow we hire\n\nNo tricks. No surprises. Here's the entire process.\n\n 1. Talk with us about the role\n    \n    - This is completely open ended and we're just trying to see who you are, what you want to do, and where you wanna go.\n\n 2. Work on a small project to discuss in the interview\n    \n    1. Review the Railway product and identify one improvement (a redesign of an existing area or a new feature that extends functionality). Then, implement one workflow to illustrate your idea—using either Figma screens, a clickable prototype, or code.\n    \n    2. Deliverable: One workflow in Figma screens, a Figma prototype, or an implementation in code that communicates your vision and design quality.\n    \n    3. You'll sit down with someone on the team and go over the above. We'll poke into your solution, as well as get you acquainted with two more members of the team.\n    \n    4. You can, and SHOULD! ask us questions ahead of time. What our prior solution looks like, what ideas we have to improve it, etc. Ask away!\n\n 3. Meet the Team\n    \n    1. You'll meet the Team, which will be comprised of 4 people from vastly different sections of the company.\n    \n    2. Looking for: How you work with the rest of the team and communicate.\n\n 4. Offer and Details Chat with CEO\n    \n    1. Finally, we will go over the process, the role, and hammer out the details about your position, onboarding, and all the deets.\n\nFinal Note: The interview goes both ways. Once again, please ask us things. Many things! Hard things. That's what we're here for.",

We think your time is sacred, whether it's at work, or outside of work.\n\n - Ownership: We're a company with a high ownership, high autonomy culture. We hope that you'll come in, help us, and over the course of many years do the best work of your life. When we bring you onboard, we expect you to change the company.\n\n - Novel problems/solutions: We're a startup that's well funded, with cool problems, which lets us implement novel solutions! We abhor “busywork” and think, whether it's community, engineering, operations, etc there's always opportunity for creative and high leverage solutions.\n\n - Growth: We want you to grow with us, but we know that talent is loaned, so when you figure out what area you want to grow in next, whether it's at Railway or outside, we'll make sure you land there.\n\nHow we hire\n\nNo tricks. No surprises. Here's the entire process.\n\n 1. Talk with us about the role\n    \n    - This is completely open ended and we're just trying to see who you are, what you want to do, and where you wanna go.\n\n 2. Work on a small project to discuss in the interview\n    \n    1. Review the Railway product and identify one improvement (a redesign of an existing area or a new feature that extends functionality). Then, implement one workflow to illustrate your idea—using either Figma screens, a clickable prototype, or code.\n    \n    2. Deliverable: One workflow in Figma screens, a Figma prototype, or an implementation in code that communicates your vision and design quality.\n    \n    3. You'll sit down with someone on the team and go over the above. We'll poke into your solution, as well as get you acquainted with two more members of the team.\n    \n    4. You can, and SHOULD! ask us questions ahead of time. What our prior solution looks like, what ideas we have to improve it, etc. Ask away!\n\n 3. Meet the Team\n    \n    1. You'll meet the Team, which will be comprised of 4 people from vastly different sections of the company.\n    \n    2. Looking for: How you work with the rest of the team and communicate.\n\n 4. Offer and Details Chat with CEO\n    \n    1. Finally, we will go over the process, the role, and hammer out the details about your position, onboarding, and all the deets.\n\nFinal Note: The interview goes both ways. Once again, please ask us things. Many things! Hard things. That's what we're here for.",

You’ll work closely with customers, partners, product, engineering, support and success, helping us maintain a secure, stable, performant, and functional Postgres foundation.\n\nThis role is ideal for someone who thrives in async, fast-paced environments and is excited about building developer tools that scale to millions.\n\n\nWHAT YOU’LL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR\n\nWe need a senior PostgreSQL engineer who brings deep knowledge of PostgreSQL internals and hands-on experience building extensions in C and Rust. You should understand how PostgreSQL works under the hood - from the parser and planner to WAL mechanics and MVCC implementation. Strong troubleshooting skills for managed PostgreSQL deployments are crucial, including diagnosing issues with custom extensions, analyzing core dumps, and resolving performance problems. You should be comfortable building testing and owning idempotent deployment to many thousands of running postgres instances.

We believe that a component is worth a thousand APIs https://youtube.com/watch?v=enUuBY3HXh4.\n\n\nWHAT YOU’LL DO\n\nAs a Growth Engineer, you’ll help developers succeed faster with Clerk by shipping measurable improvements across our growth surfaces—SDK, docs/quickstart, dashboard onboarding, backend, and email. You’ll move quickly and learn in public with a team that cares about craft and outcomes.\n\nWe will expect you to:\n\n - Ship experiments across any surface (Clerk SDKs, docs/quickstart, dashboard, backend, email/CRM).\n\n - Collaborate across engineering, design, product, and marketing to improve developer’s experiences using Clerk.\n\n - Operate across the full stack: Next.js + JavaScript/TypeScript (including our JS SDK), Go services backed by Postgres; BigQuery and PostHog for analysis and flags.\n\n - Establish clear hypothesis and success metrics for every experiment; instrument, launch behind flags, monitor, and share read-outs.\n\n\nWHO YOU ARE\n\n - Five+ years hands-on software engineering.\n\n - 1–2+ years running growth experiments in PLG/SaaS (dev tools experience is ideal).\n\n - Full-stack fluency with professional experience in JavaScript/TypeScript (Next.js) and Go, plus strong SQL.\n\n - Confident with your data.

We provide a complete backend solution including Database, Auth, Storage, Edge Functions, Realtime, and Vector Search. All services are deeply integrated and designed for growth.\n\nWe're seeking a Brand Designer to join our team.\n\nAs a Brand Designer at Supabase, you’ll play a crucial role in shaping our visual storytelling across a variety of mediums, including decks, printed materials, YouTube content, and conference assets. Working closely with Marketing, DevRel, Success and Enterprise teams, you’ll bring our ideas to life with compelling visuals that engage our developer community and amplify our brand at conferences, events, swag, and beyond.\n\nYour work will have a direct impact on how developers perceive and engage with Supabase, helping to create a cohesive and powerful brand presence across all touch points. You’ll push creative boundaries and set high standards for visual communication that resonates with our audience.\n\nYou’ll have opportunities to lead, propose, and execute projects across various formats, from polished presentations to impactful print designs. Your contributions will help tell Supabase’s story in a way that is consistent and memorable.\n\nWe Need:\n\n - Design Expertise: Proficiency in design tools like Figma, Adobe Creative Suite (like InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop), and presentation tools (like Google Slides, Keynote, PowerPoint — maybe Figma Slides?).\n\n - Creative Storyteller: Ability to craft cohesive and engaging visual narratives for presentations, printed materials, and digital assets.\n\n - Multi-Channel Design Experience: Comfort designing across various formats, including print, video, and social media.\n\n - Collaboration and Communication: Excellent communication skills, with experience working with cross-functional teams, including Marketing, Sales, Product, and Events.\n\n - Brand Consistency: Strong understanding of branding principles, ensuring all materials adhere to Supabase’s visual identity and messaging.\n\n - Attention to Detail: High standards for design quality and consistency across all formats and channels.\n\n - Print enthusiast: You know what 300gsm vs 100gsm feels like.\n\nWhat We Don’t Need:\n\n - Lone Wolves: If you prefer to work independently without regular collaboration, this role isn’t for you.\n\n - Resistance to Feedback: Comfort with iterating based on feedback, data, and testing is key.\n\n - Narrow Focus: Comfort with a variety of projects and adaptability to work across digital, print, and video is essential.\n\n - Feature-Only Mindset: We prioritize cohesive storytelling and visual impact over isolated, unconnected designs.\n\n - Low Initiative: We’re looking for proactive, resourceful designers who bring ideas to the table.\n\n - “Re-do Everything” Approach: Focus on incremental improvements rather than overhauling everything at once.\n\n - Inflexibility: This role requires adaptability to changing requirements and team dynamics.\n\n\nWHAT WE OFFER\n\n - Fully Remote\n   \n   We hire globally. We believe you can do your best work from anywhere. There are no Supabase offices, but we provide a WeWork membership or co-working allowance you can use anywhere in the world.\n\n - ESOP\n   \n   Every team member receives ESOP (equity ownership) in the company. We want everyone to share in the upside of what we’re building together.\n\n - Tech Allowance\n   \n   Use this budget to set up your ideal work environment—laptop, monitor, headphones, or whatever helps you do your best work.\n\n - Health Benefits\n   \n   Supabase covers 100% of health insurance for employees and 80% for dependents, wherever you are. Your wellbeing and your family’s health are important to us.\n\n - Annual Off-Sites\n   \n   Once a year, the entire company gathers in a new city for a week of connection, collaboration, and fun. It’s a highlight of our year.\n\n - Flexible Work\n   \n   We operate asynchronously and trust you to manage your own time. You know what needs to be done and when.\n\n - Professional Development\n   \n   Every team member receives an annual education allowance to spend on learning—courses, books, conferences, or anything that supports your growth.\n\n\nABOUT THE TEAM\n\nSupabase was born-remote and open-source-first. We believe our globally distributed team is our secret weapon in building tools developers love.\n\n - 180+ team members\n\n - 40+ countries\n\n - 15+ languages spoken\n\n - $496M raised\n\n - 430,000+ community members\n\n - 30,000+ memes posted (and counting)\n\nWe move fast, build in public, and use what we ship. If it’s in your project, we probably use it in ours too. We believe deeply in the open-source ecosystem and strive to support—not replace—existing tools and communities.\n\n\nHIRING PROCESS\n\nWe keep things simple, async-friendly, and respectful of your time:\n\n 1. Apply – Our team will review your application.\n\n 2. Intro Call – A short video chat to get to know each other.\n\n 3. Interviews – Up to four calls with:\n    \n    - Founders\n    \n    - Future teammates\n    \n    - Someone cross-functional from product, growth, or engineering (depending on the role)\n\n 4. Decision – We may follow up with a final question or go straight to offer.\n\nAll communication is remote and we aim to move fast.",

We want everyone to share in the upside of what we’re building together.\n\n - Tech Allowance\n   \n   Use this budget to set up your ideal work environment—laptop, monitor, headphones, or whatever helps you do your best work.\n\n - Health Benefits\n   \n   Supabase covers 100% of health insurance for employees and 80% for dependents, wherever you are. Your wellbeing and your family’s health are important to us.\n\n - Annual Off-Sites\n   \n   Once a year, the entire company gathers in a new city for a week of connection, collaboration, and fun. It’s a highlight of our year.\n\n - Flexible Work\n   \n   We operate asynchronously and trust you to manage your own time. You know what needs to be done and when.\n\n - Professional Development\n   \n   Every team member receives an annual education allowance to spend on learning—courses, books, conferences, or anything that supports your growth.\n\n\nABOUT THE TEAM\n\nSupabase was born-remote and open-source-first. We believe our globally distributed team is our secret weapon in building tools developers love.\n\n - 180+ team members\n\n - 40+ countries\n\n - 15+ languages spoken\n\n - $496M raised\n\n - 430,000+ community members\n\n - 30,000+ memes posted (and counting)\n\nWe move fast, build in public, and use what we ship. If it’s in your project, we probably use it in ours too. We believe deeply in the open-source ecosystem and strive to support—not replace—existing tools and communities.\n\n\nHIRING PROCESS\n\nWe keep things simple, async-friendly, and respectful of your time:\n\n 1. Apply – Our team will review your application.\n\n 2. Intro Call – A short video chat to get to know each other.\n\n 3. Interviews – Up to four calls with:\n    \n    - Founders\n    \n    - Future teammates\n    \n    - Someone cross-functional from product, growth, or engineering (depending on the role)\n\n 4. Decision – We may follow up with a final question or go straight to offer.\n\nAll communication is remote and we aim to move fast.",

These components allow developers to drop authentication and user management into their applications. We believe that a component is worth a thousand APIs https://youtube.com/watch?v=enUuBY3HXh4.\n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE\n\nIt’s an exciting time for Clerk, coming off a year of record user growth and product launches that further our vision of making authentication and user management intuitive and enjoyable.

At Clerk, we want to ensure that you have everything you need to perform at your best.\n\n - We believe in work-life balance and trust you to take the time you need. Although we recommend 25 days per year, our vacation policy is unlimited.

Today, we provide developers with full-stack React components and hooks like <SignUp/> https://clerk.dev/components/sign-up, <SignIn/> https://clerk.dev/components/sign-in, <UserProfile/> https://clerk.dev/components/user-profile, useUser https://clerk.com/docs/references/react/use-user, and useOrganization https://clerk.com/docs/references/react/use-organization. These APIs allow developers to build hard-to-get-right user and organization management flows. We believe that a component is worth a thousand APIs https://youtube.com/watch?v=enUuBY3HXh4.\n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE\n\nClerk is looking for product-minded Software Engineers comfortable with Golang and ideally Typescript as well to help us build out our core authentication product. This backend-oriented, full-stack role will have you work on nimble teams and connect directly with customers to define and execute functionality that developers love and support builders launching and growing their businesses.\n\n\nWHAT YOU’LL DO\n\nWe’re a small but growing team with big ambitions. This means you’ll have responsibility far beyond closing out pre-written tickets. We’re looking for people that are comfortable working across the stack to solve complex product problems for real users.\n\n - Shape the Clerk authentication experience – Build, improve, and evolve Clerk’s beloved managed authentication product. Your work will directly influence how thousands of teams interact with Clerk daily.\n\n - Design and implement new product features – From features like advanced OAuth and MCP to secure session management to audit logs and observability, you’ll build new functionality that makes it easier for users to authenticate and for developers to manage their users at scale.\n\n - Improve usability and workflows – Partner with design and product to streamline the utility, clarity, and efficiency of the auth product so developers can stop worrying about auth entirely, and focus on building their own products.\n\n - Build for observability and transparency – Create data pipelines and tools that help developers understand authentication flows, diagnose issues, and gain confidence in the systems they’ve built with Clerk.\n\n - Collaborate with customers and teammates – Be part of a world-class product delivery team that cares deeply about customer needs and the value of constant iteration. We’re fully remote, which means you’ll need to practice good communication habits to keep things moving.\n\n - Execute – Clerk values engineers who execute. That means approaching work iteratively and reducing the time between feedback cycles.\n\n - Thrive in a dynamic environment – Clerk is not well suited for engineers who expect every task to be a series of predefined steps. We believe the best approach is to work through our customer’s problems in the trenches and not merely think through them from the sidelines.\n\n - Be Customer 0 – Clerk is built on top of Clerk. That means the work you do to solve our internal projects likely will also become functionality that we release to customers as well. We are looking for engineers who care deeply about product quality and want to back that up with their work.\n\n - Embrace a culture of craft by focusing on engineering quality. We want our product to be best-in-class, and so we need our team to write maintainable, performant, and well-structured code.\n\n\nWHO YOU ARE\n\n - You’re comfortable writing idiomatic Golang code and and ideally also know your way around modern frontend stacks (even if not a frontend expert). Our architecture is built on top of GCP and Cloudflare with a Golang backend and React/Typescript frontend.\n\n - You value building clean and performant APIs\n\n - Event-driven architectures, Pub/Sub patterns, and scaling challenges are familiar territory.\n\n - You set a high bar for code quality, system design, and performance — and you’re not afraid to fight for it.\n\n - You’re passionate about building for other engineers and obsess over making their experience better.\n\n - You believe in solving real customer problems, even if it means making tradeoffs behind the scenes.\n\n - You understand that the purity of your systems are second to the the outcomes they enable for our customers. The entire aim of Clerk is to take on complexity on their behalf. That can mean making tradeoffs to our own systems.\n\n - You love working on products you use yourself — because you know that’s how magic happens.\n\n\nBENEFITS\n\n - Competitive Salary – We want you to know that we value the skills and experience you bring to the table. We go out of our way to make sure that you feel fairly compensated.\n\n - Equity Ownership – At Clerk, we believe in shared success. That's why we offer a stock option plan so that everyone can benefit from the growth and prosperity of the company.\n\n - Work Gear - Set up your ideal home office with the gear of your choice. At Clerk, we want to ensure that you have everything you need to perform at your best.\n\n - Flexible Vacation Policy – We believe in work-life balance and trust you to take the time you need. Although we recommend 25 days per year, our vacation policy is unlimited. This is in addition to observing national holidays specific to your country of residence.\n\n - Diverse and Inclusive Team – Join our exceptional, diverse, and globally distributed team at Clerk. We are committed to fostering an inclusive environment where everyone can contribute their best in building impactful products and tools for the modern web.",

It is about designing the contracting, pricing, and partnership pathways that shape the future of our government and large prime business.

As a result, stuff is ALWAYS happening.\n\n - We do NOT expect you to work all the time, but you'll have to be diligent about your boundaries because the end of your day may overlap with the start of someone else's.\n\n - We're a small team, with high ownership, who are not only passionate about what we do, but seek to be exceptional as well. At the time of writing we're 21, serving hundreds of thousands of users. There's a lot of stuff going on, and a lot of ambiguity.\n\n - We want you to own it. We believe that ownership is a key to growth, and part of that growth is not only being able to make the choices, but owning the success, or failure, that comes with those choices.\n\nBenefits and perks\n\nAt Railway, we provide best in class benefits. Great salary, full health benefits including dependents, strong equity grants, equipment stipend, and much more. For more details, check back on the main careers page https://railway.app/careers/full-stack.\n\nBeyond compensation, there are a few things that we believe that make working at Railway truly unique:\n\n - Autonomy: We have very few meetings. Just a Monday and a Friday to go over the Company Board. We think your time is sacred, whether it's at work, or outside of work.\n\n - Ownership: We're a company with a high ownership, high autonomy culture. We hope that you'll come in, help us, and over the course of many years do the best work of your life. When we bring you onboard, we expect you to change the company.\n\n - Novel problems/solutions: We're a startup that's well funded, with cool problems, which lets us implement novel solutions! We abhor “busywork” and think, whether it's community, engineering, operations, etc there's always opportunity for creative and high leverage solutions.\n\n - Growth: We want you to grow with us, but we know that talent is loaned, so when you figure out what area you want to grow in next, whether it's at Railway or outside, we'll make sure you land there.\n\nHow we hire\n\nNo tricks. No surprises. Here's the entire process:\n\n 1. Talk with us about the role\n    \n    - This is completely open ended and we're just trying to see who you are, what you want to do, and where you wanna go.\n\n 2. Work on a small project to discuss in the interview\n    \n    - Asynchronously implement the following:\n    \n    - Pre-interview: Design a datacenter procurement, buildout, and management process from scratch\n    \n    - You can, and SHOULD! ask us questions ahead of time.\n\n 3. Review your solution with the Team\n    \n    1. You'll sit down with someone on the team and go over the above. We'll poke into your solution, as well as get you acquainted with two more members of the team.\n       \n       1. Looking for: Learn about your problem solving skills. How you break down a problem and how you present a solution.\n    \n    2. Interview Structure (60 Minutes):\n       \n       1. Pre-work (before your interview): Complete your solution (advised)\n       \n       2. 0-5m: introduction\n       \n       3. 5-50m: Building (or expanding) your solution\n       \n       4. 50-60m: Questions on Railway/Tech/etc\n\n 4. Meet the Team\n    \n    1. You'll meet the Team, which will be comprised of 4 people from vastly different sections of the company.\n       \n       1. Looking for: How you work with the rest of the team and communicate.\n\n 5. Offer and Details Chat with CEO\n    \n    1. Finally, we will go over the process, the role, and hammer out the details about your position, onboarding, and all the deets.\n\n#Global",

      "job_description": "This is a remote position available anywhere in the world! Linkedin makes us show a country, but we hire the best people wherever they are.\n\nAt Railway, we make it extremely simple for engineers to deploy logic without thinking about servers. Our goal is to make developers orders of magnitude more efficient by becoming the operating system for modern development.\n\nDev Rel is an often misunderstood role, we see it as a hybrid of being able to make cool stuff and talking about it, but also being the tip of the spear in getting feedback from the market. You should be knowledgeable about modern DevOps practices, the state of the cloud infra world, while being opinionated about how the next 10 years of Dev Tools should look like.\n\nThis is a high impact, high agency role where you are given a high degree of autonomy to work with any function you desire while receiving any support from the team you need. As our first hire in this area, we expect you to wear a lot of hats while setting the strategy.\n\nWant to learn about our work culture? Here is a three-part blog series that will help you see the unique ways our team works (Parts 1 https://blog.railway.app/p/how-we-work, 2 https://blog.railway.app/p/how-we-work-volume-ii, 3 https://blog.railway.app/p/how-we-work-volume-iii, and 4 https://blog.railway.com/p/how-we-work-volume-iv).\n\nAbout the role\n\nFor this role, you will:\n\n - Implement programs to gather developer feedback and then exercise discretion on how to best communicate to those users\n\n - Build and refine product adoption loops through content, improvements to the product, and nurturing community\n\n - Assist the team on initiatives around our Open Source presence such as our CLI, Nixpacks, and Templates\n\n - Craft resources that help grow the developer ecosystem and ensure that the experience for new and existing users is as seamless as possible\n\nAbout you\n\n - A strong ability to communicate clearly, whether it's via writing, video, or practical projects incorporating Railway\n\n - A enthusiast about our product, Railway uses Railway to build Railway. (Say that 5 times fast) You should be able to share insights with developers of all stripes to let them know how our product can help them\n\n - A great sense of direction and prioritization when it comes to dealing with the ambiguity of an early stage startup\n\n - Someone who is comfortable in a few different languages/stacks and can create educational content on how to deploy those projects on a public cloud (the status quo) or Railway (the thing we hope to be better than the status quo)\n\n - Able to take really technical concepts and make it as easy to understand as possible\n\nWe value and love to work with diverse persons from all backgrounds\n\nThings to Know\n\nFor better or worse, we're a startup; our team dynamics are different from companies of different sizes and stages.\n\n - We're distributed ALL across the globe, and that's only going to be more and more distributed. As a result, stuff is ALWAYS happening.\n\n - We do NOT expect you to work all the time, but you'll have to be diligent about your boundaries because the end of your day may overlap with the start of someone else's.\n\n - We're a small team, with high ownership, who are not only passionate about what we do, but seek to be exceptional as well. At the time of writing we're 21, serving hundreds of thousands of users. There's a lot of stuff going on, and a lot of ambiguity.\n\n - We want you to own it. We believe that ownership is a key to growth, and part of that growth is not only being able to make the choices, but owning the success, or failure, that comes with those choices.\n\nBenefits and Perks\n\nAt Railway, we provide best in class benefits. Great salary, full health benefits including dependents, strong equity grants, equipment stipend, and much more. For more details, check back on the main careers page https://railway.app/careers/developer-relations.\n\nBeyond compensation, there are a few things that we believe that make working at Railway truly unique:\n\n - Autonomy: We have very few meetings. Just a Monday and a Friday to go over the Company Board. We think your time is sacred, whether it's at work, or outside of work.\n\n - Ownership: We're a company with a high ownership, high autonomy culture. We hope that you'll come in, help us, and over the course of many years do the best work of your life. When we bring you onboard, we expect you to change the company.\n\n - Novel problems/solutions: We're a startup that's well funded, with cool problems, which lets us implement novel solutions! We abhor “busywork” and think, whether it's community, engineering, operations, etc there's always opportunity for creative and high leverage solutions.\n\n - Growth: We want you to grow with us, but we know that talent is loaned, so when you figure out what area you want to grow in next, whether it's at Railway or outside, we'll make sure you land there.\n\nHow We Hire\n\nNo tricks. No surprises. Here's the entire process.\n\n 1. Talk with us about the role\n    \n    - This is completely open ended and we're just trying to see who you are, what you want to do, and where you wanna go.\n\n 2. Work on a small project to discuss in the interview\n    \n    - Asynchronously implement the following:\n    \n    - Build something and deploy it on Railway using as many features as possible\n    \n    - You will submit your solution before the interview, and you'll sit down with a member of the team and go over the above. We'll poke into your solution, as well as get you acquainted with a member of the team.\n    \n    - You can, and SHOULD ask us questions ahead of time if you have them.\n\n 3. Review your solution with the Team\n    \n    - You'll sit down with someone on the team and go over the above. We'll poke into your solution, as well as get you acquainted with two more members of the team.\n    \n    - Looking for: Learn about your problem solving skills. How you break down a problem and how you present a solution.\n    \n    - Interview Structure (60 Minutes):\n      \n      - Pre-work (submitted before your interview): Build and deploy your project\n      \n      - 0-5 minutes: Introduction\n      \n      - 5-20 minutes: Walking through the project\n      \n      - 20-50 minutes: Walking through how you think about content, relations, intersection with other roles\n      \n      - 50-60 minutes: Time for you to ask your interviewers questions\n\n 4. Meet the Team\n    \n    - You'll meet the Team, which will be comprised of 4 people from vastly different sections of the company.\n    \n    - Looking for: How you work with the rest of the team and communicate.\n\n 5. Offer and Details Chat with CEO\n    \n    1. Finally, we will go over the process, the role, and hammer out the details about your position, onboarding, and all the deets.\n\nFinal Note: The interview goes both ways. Once again, please ask us things. Many things! Hard things. That's what we're here for.\n\n#Global",

(Say that 5 times fast) You should be able to share insights with developers of all stripes to let them know how our product can help them\n\n - A great sense of direction and prioritization when it comes to dealing with the ambiguity of an early stage startup\n\n - Someone who is comfortable in a few different languages/stacks and can create educational content on how to deploy those projects on a public cloud (the status quo) or Railway (the thing we hope to be better than the status quo)\n\n - Able to take really technical concepts and make it as easy to understand as possible\n\nWe value and love to work with diverse persons from all backgrounds\n\nThings to Know\n\nFor better or worse, we're a startup; our team dynamics are different from companies of different sizes and stages.\n\n - We're distributed ALL across the globe, and that's only going to be more and more distributed. As a result, stuff is ALWAYS happening.\n\n - We do NOT expect you to work all the time, but you'll have to be diligent about your boundaries because the end of your day may overlap with the start of someone else's.\n\n - We're a small team, with high ownership, who are not only passionate about what we do, but seek to be exceptional as well. At the time of writing we're 21, serving hundreds of thousands of users. There's a lot of stuff going on, and a lot of ambiguity.\n\n - We want you to own it. We believe that ownership is a key to growth, and part of that growth is not only being able to make the choices, but owning the success, or failure, that comes with those choices.\n\nBenefits and Perks\n\nAt Railway, we provide best in class benefits. Great salary, full health benefits including dependents, strong equity grants, equipment stipend, and much more.

Just a Monday and a Friday to go over the Company Board. We think your time is sacred, whether it's at work, or outside of work.\n\n - Ownership: We're a company with a high ownership, high autonomy culture. We hope that you'll come in, help us, and over the course of many years do the best work of your life. When we bring you onboard, we expect you to change the company.\n\n - Novel problems/solutions: We're a startup that's well funded, with cool problems, which lets us implement novel solutions! We abhor “busywork” and think, whether it's community, engineering, operations, etc there's always opportunity for creative and high leverage solutions.\n\n - Growth: We want you to grow with us, but we know that talent is loaned, so when you figure out what area you want to grow in next, whether it's at Railway or outside, we'll make sure you land there.\n\nHow We Hire\n\nNo tricks.

Linkedin makes us show a country, but we hire the best people wherever they are.\n\nOur core mission at Railway is to make software engineers higher leverage. We believe that people should be given powerful tools so that they can spend less time setting up to do, and more time doing.\n\nBuilding the infrastructure which powers the Railway engine is the most core problem at Railway. As a infrastructure engineer, you will be directly responsible for exposing the knobs, bells, and whistles that allow the users to build to the wildest dreams. The tools you build will be instrumental in not only scaling internal operations, but scaling the company to infinite and beyond!\n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE\n\nFor this role, you will:\n\n - Build system-level software: our challenges aren't your usual kube-fits-all variety, so be prepared to build things from scratch based on first principles\n\n - Have a strong understanding or curiosity of OS level primitives - our business hinges on efficiency, so that means being masters of CPU, Memory, Network and the Kernel that wields it\n\n - Be a student of both distributed systems and simplicity - you know how to reach for the RAFT but you also know how far you can get with Postgres\n\n - Roll with the boring: build Golang/Rust GRPC services from scratch to expose your complex capabilities to the wider company in a scalable and performant manner\n\n - This is a high impact, high agency role with direct effect on company culture, trajectory, and outcome\n\n - You may be oncall from time to time in this role\n\n\nABOUT YOU\n\n - A strong understanding of distributed systems. You enjoy building fault tolerant, resilient, and scalable services\n\n - A solid intuition about how long your solutions will last. All systems age. In startups, we can hope for 2-3 orders of magnitude, or 12-18mo.\n\n - The tact to implement your solution, creator monitors for it’s error boundaries, and document any requirements for when you’re not around\n\n - A great sense of direction and prioritization when it comes to dealing with the ambiguity of an early stage startup\n\n - A sense of grit to dive into a problem, implement a solution, scale that solution, and replace it when needed\n\n - A great set of communication skills for getting your point across, solution implemented, and beyond\n\nWe value and love to work with diverse persons from all backgrounds\n\nThings to know\n\nFor better or worse, we're a startup; our team dynamics are different from companies of different sizes and stages.\n\n - We're distributed ALL across the globe, and that's only going to be more and more distributed. As a result, stuff is ALWAYS happening.\n\n - We do NOT expect you to work all the time, but you'll have to be diligent about your boundaries because the end of your day may overlap with the start of someone else's.\n\n - We're a small team, with high ownership, who are not only passionate about what we do, but seek to be exceptional as well. At the time of writing we're 21, serving hundreds of thousands of users. There's a lot of stuff going on, and a lot of ambiguity.\n\n - We want you to own it. We believe that ownership is a key to growth, and part of that growth is not only being able to make the choices, but owning the success, or failure, that comes with those choices.\n\nBenefits and perks\n\nAt Railway, we provide best in class benefits. Great salary, full health benefits including dependents, strong equity grants, equipment stipend, and much more. For more details, check back on the main careers page https://railway.app/careers/full-stack.\n\nBeyond compensation, there are a few things that we believe that make working at Railway truly unique:\n\n - Autonomy: We have very few meetings. Just a Monday and a Friday to go over the Company Board. We think your time is sacred, whether it's at work, or outside of work.\n\n - Ownership: We're a company with a high ownership, high autonomy culture. We hope that you'll come in, help us, and over the course of many years do the best work of your life. When we bring you onboard, we expect you to change the company.\n\n - Novel problems/solutions: We're a startup that's well funded, with cool problems, which lets us implement novel solutions! We abhor “busywork” and think, whether it's community, engineering, operations, etc there's always opportunity for creative and high leverage solutions.\n\n - Growth: We want you to grow with us, but we know that talent is loaned, so when you figure out what area you want to grow in next, whether it's at Railway or outside, we'll make sure you land there.\n\nHow we hire\n\nNo tricks. No surprises. Here's the entire process:\n\n 1. Talk with us about the role\n    \n    - This is completely open ended and we're just trying to see who you are, what you want to do, and where you wanna go.\n\n 2. Work on a small project to discuss in the interview\n    \n    - Asynchronously implement the following:\n    \n    - Pre-interview: Architect a Container Provisioning Engine to power something like Railway\n    \n    - You can, and SHOULD! ask us questions ahead of time.\n\n 3. Review your solution with the Team\n    \n    1. You'll sit down with someone on the team and go over the above. We'll poke into your solution, as well as get you acquainted with two more members of the team.\n       \n       1. Looking for: Learn about your problem solving skills. How you break down a problem and how you present a solution.\n    \n    2. Interview Structure (60 Minutes):\n       \n       1.

Meet the Team\n    \n    1. You'll meet the Team, which will be comprised of 4 people from vastly different sections of the company.\n       \n       1. Looking for: How you work with the rest of the team and communicate.\n\n 5. Offer and Details Chat with CEO\n    \n    1.

      "job_description": "This is a remote position available anywhere in the world! Linkedin makes us show a country, but we hire the best people wherever they are.\n\nOur core mission at Railway is to make software engineers higher leverage. We believe that people should be given powerful tools so that they can spend less time setting up to do, and more time doing.\n\nAt Railway, we believe that making tooling more accessible for build and deployment is one of the greatest possible productivity unlocks of our generation. We also believe that the major roadblock between us and our goal is strong interfacing paradigms.\n\nIf you’re looking to build an operating system for builders, we’d love to talk with you!\n\nCurious? Learn more in our blog post about this team and the great work they’re doing: Team Spotlight: Product Engineering (https://blog.railway.app/p/team-spotlight-product-engineering)\n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE\n\nFor this role, you will:\n\n - Build features end-to-end, from the UI in our dashboard to orchestrating workflows that interact with our microservices using Temporal.\n\n - Craft intuitive interfaces that allow our users to interface with powerful computing paradigms, with help from our design team.\n\n - Build TypeScript + GraphQL APIs with strong guarantees around modeling data, allowing both internal and external users to build against.\n\n - Write Engineering Requirement Documents to take something from idea, to defined tasks, to implementation, to monitoring it’s success.\n\n - Experience with, or at least the desire to learn Rust to contribute to our open-source repositories (CLI, Nixpacks https://nixpacks.com/docs, etc).\n\nSome projects full-stack engineers have worked on in the past\n\n - Rebuild logging infrastructure https://blog.railway.app/p/launch-week-01-observability to support 1B logs/day, from configuring ClickHouse to developing a brand new observability UI\n\n - Build Git for infrastructure https://blog.railway.app/p/launch-week-01-changesets and re-thinking how a project evolves over time\n\n - Build a tool for building user code into a deployable image using Nix packages. (github.com/railwayapp/nixpacks) http://github.com/railwayapp/nixpacks\n\n - Create interfaces to visualize project infrastructure on a 2D canvas https://community.railway.app/discuss/thread/service-groups-c1faed81\n\n - Add support for migrating deployments with a volume from one region to another using Temporal\n\n - Create a marketplace https://railway.app/templates for users to share re-usable pieces of infrastructure\n\nThis is a high impact, high agency role with direct effect on company culture, trajectory, and outcome.\n\n\nABOUT YOU\n\n - An ability to autonomously lead, design, and implement great product experiences, from front to back.\n\n - A strong understanding of frontend architecture to build interactivity-rich systems for fetching, mutating, and rendering data effectively\n\n - Experience managing complex asynchronous backend jobs for something like a build/deploy pipeline.\n\n - A desire to be a part of the entire project development process. From research gathering and planning, to implementation and monitoring\n\n - Great written and verbal communication skills for expressing ideas, designs, and potential solutions in mostly-asynchronous manner\n\nWe value and love to work with diverse persons from all backgrounds\n\nThings to know\n\nFor better or worse, we're a startup; our team dynamics are different from companies of different sizes and stages.\n\n - We're distributed ALL across the globe, and that's only going to be more and more distributed. As a result, stuff is ALWAYS happening.\n\n - We do NOT expect you to work all the time, but you'll have to be diligent about your boundaries because the end of your day may overlap with the start of someone else's.\n\n - We're a small team, with high ownership, who are not only passionate about what we do, but seek to be exceptional as well. At the time of writing we're 21, serving hundreds of thousands of users. There's a lot of stuff going on, and a lot of ambiguity.\n\n - We want you to own it. We believe that ownership is a key to growth, and part of that growth is not only being able to make the choices, but owning the success, or failure, that comes with those choices.\n\nBenefits and perks\n\nAt Railway, we provide best in class benefits. Great salary, full health benefits including dependents, strong equity grants, equipment stipend, and much more. For more details, check back on the main careers page https://railway.app/careers/full-stack.\n\nBeyond compensation, there are a few things that we believe that make working at Railway truly unique:\n\n - Autonomy: We have very few meetings. Just a Monday and a Friday to go over the Company Board. We think your time is sacred, whether it's at work, or outside of work.\n\n - Ownership: We're a company with a high ownership, high autonomy culture. We hope that you'll come in, help us, and over the course of many years do the best work of your life. When we bring you onboard, we expect you to change the company.\n\n - Novel problems/solutions: We're a startup that's well funded, with cool problems, which lets us implement novel solutions! We abhor “busywork” and think, whether it's community, engineering, operations, etc there's always opportunity for creative and high leverage solutions.\n\n - Growth: We want you to grow with us, but we know that talent is loaned, so when you figure out what area you want to grow in next, whether it's at Railway or outside, we'll make sure you land there.\n\nHow we hire\n\nNo tricks. No surprises. Here's the entire process:\n\n 1. Talk with us about the role\n    \n    - This is completely open ended and we're just trying to see who you are, what you want to do, and where you wanna go.\n\n 2. Work on a small project to discuss in the interview\n    \n    - Asynchronously implement the following:\n      \n      - Build an application to spin up and spin down a container using our GQL API. Please deploy on Railway before the interview and we will review the code during your interview. The app needs to have a UI component and not just a backend that uses the API.\n      \n      - You will submit your solution before the interview, and sit down with a member of the team and go over the above. We'll poke into your solution, as well as get you acquainted with a member of the team.\n      \n      - You can, and SHOULD! ask us questions ahead of time.\n\n 3. Review your solution with the Team\n    \n    1. You'll sit down with someone on the team and go over the above. We'll poke into your solution, as well as get you acquainted with a member of the team.\n       \n       1. Looking for: Learn about your problem solving skills. How you break down a problem and how you present a solution.\n       \n       2. Interview Structure to expect when you review with the team (60 Minutes):\n       \n       3. 0-5 minutes: Introductions\n       \n       4. 5-35 minutes: Walking through the code, talking about how you’d extend it\n       \n       5. 35-50 minutes: Noodling on technology, frameworks, how you think about product\n       \n       6. 50-60 minutes: Time for you to ask your interviewers question\n\n 4. Meet the Team\n    \n    1. You'll meet the Team, which will be comprised of 4 people from vastly different sections of the company.\n       \n       1. Looking for: How you work with the rest of the team and communicate.\n\n 5. Offer and Details Chat with CEO\n    \n    1. Finally, we will go over the process, the role, and hammer out the details about your position, onboarding, and all the deets.\n\n#Global",
