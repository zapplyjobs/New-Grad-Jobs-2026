You’ll work with a variety of products and touch many different code components on a single project. Your main responsibility is to bring new features into production from beginning to end. Depending on the project this can entail many different things, but here are some examples of typical tasks you may encounter in a day: Understand and discuss requirements with team members, i.e. traders and researchers Design, implement, test and optimize trading algorithms and strategies ensuring our competitiveness in the market Continuously improve and guard the long-term architecture of our in-house developed trading system in terms of latency, accuracy, capacity, regulations etc. Work closely with Trading, Research and Trading Intelligence to innovate the way we do things, i.e. by automating and optimizing workflows Manage various operational aspects to bring your projects to completion, such as deploy, monitor and tweak systems Investigate opportunities and solve problems and as they occur with a hands-on, pragmatic approach Requirements: A background in Computer Science or similar Highly skilled in C++ Programming knowledge in Python is preferable but can otherwise be learned on the job Serious about code quality, taking full responsibility and accountability for your contributions Practical and results-driven attitude Good communication skills, with the ability to understand requirements and explain technical concepts to non-technical people Desire to work in a multidisciplinary team environment, including collaborating with traders and researchers on a daily basis Benefits: An opportunity to work beside the best in the field Base salary of USD 160k Excellent variable pay based on performance, with a fair bonus-structure awarding company profits to software engineers, traders and researchers alike Outstanding performance is also rewarded with shareholding in the company Relocation package when moving across states Training period in Amsterdam to get to know the team Comprehensive benefits package including medical, dental, and vision insurance 25 vacation days each year Meals during work hours Social events and after-work drinks Our trading system: As a trading company, one of our proudest moments was going live with our very own trading system, developed from scratch by our excellent engineers. Melzi, named after Leonardo Da Vinci’s favorite student, was designed with our very own unique needs and priorities in mind. Since launching, our traders have been very excited to work with this custom-made and highly efficient system. Process: Coding challenge: This take-home assessment will give you a chance to understand the role further through similar tasks to the ones you’ll encounter on our trading floor. It allows us to assess your coding skills, as well as your approach to problem solving. HR Interview: In this conversation with one of our recruiters, you will learn more about Da Vinci and give us the opportunity to get to know you better. We will assess whether your soft skills and motivators fit our way of working. Technical Interview: During this conversation with one of our lead engineers you will get to geek out on your knowledge of computer science and C++ programming.
