How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

      "job_description": "We’ve learned that what is best for patients is also best for employees. Learn more about why we are one of the Best Companies to Work for in Texas.\n\nFull-Time\n\nNights\n\n7p-7a\n\n84 hour plan (36 hours one week, 48 hours following week)\n\nThe Emergency Center is a level 1 trauma center 64 bed unit which includes a 7 bed pediatric emergency area. The Emergency Center provides a unique opportunity to experience a variety of patient situations including care of trauma, cardiac, stroke, pediatric, and burn patients. While in the Emergency Center you will orient to all areas of the Emergency Center.\n\nTriage : Triage training will offer you the best view of how the emergency center flows. As a triage nurse you are the decision maker for each patient that is waiting to be seen. You are instructed on the ESI 5 tier index triage system and will begin using this in making decisions on how sick a patient may be and if it is safe for them to wait or not. This again is the most important part of your orientation, because it will carry over into your patient care as a primary nurse to all patients in the Emergency Center. As an experienced nurse, you may have previously used this system and therefore, you will adapt to how this Emergency Center utilizes ESI.\n\nGeneral Medical : Offers a comprehensive experience caring for all types of patients. You will care for patients that are stable to emergently needing care. This area is where you will learn the flow of the Emergency Center and all of the documentation and functionality of the EC.\n\nSuper-Fast Track : Offers the opportunity to explore patients that are very stable and only need one to two diagnostics to come to a disposition. This is a very fast paced area and will really offer you a chance to do focused assessments rather than extensive assessments. You will become very proficient in learning how to focus on the true problem the patient has.\n\nCritical Care : This zone of the Emergency Center offers the opportunity to explore a wide array of pathophysiology. This patient population includes multi-system organ failure, respiratory failure, diabetic emergencies, drug overdoses, autoimmune crisis, and many other critically ill patients.\n\nTrauma Care : Offers a variety of opportunities for advanced patient care in the region’s only Level I Trauma Center. You will care for patients immediately after a traumatic event and will assist the surgery team, orthopedics, neurosurgery team and burn team deciding the further plan of care for that patient. The Burn Center is the region’s only verified burn center. You will care for burns and other soft tissue injuries such as toxic epidermal necrolysis, necrotizing soft tissue infections, and snakebites.\n\nRegistered professional nurse who assesses, implements or delegates, plans, and evaluates total nursing care and functions in accordance with established philosophy, providing and directing patient care for a group of patients. Relates effectively with other shifts / departments for optimal continuity of care.\n\nQualifications :\n• Graduation from an accredited School of Nursing\n• Valid Texas GN Permit or newly licensed RN with no experience\n• Must maintain a current BLS & ACLS & PALS certification from American Heart\n\nAssociation\n• BSN required or must be obtained within 3 years of hire\n• TNCC required or obtained upon hire\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nUMC Health System provides equal employment opportunities to all employees and applicants for employment and prohibits discrimination and harassment on the basis of race, color, religion, age, sex, national origin, disability status, genetics, protected veteran status, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or any other characteristic protected by federal, state or local laws.\n• Request for accommodations in the hire process should be directed to UMC Human Resources.​",

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic’s Compute and Infrastructure organizations are responsible for the systems that train our models, serve our products, and support our engineering teams. That includes datacenter operations, capacity planning across cloud providers and our own facilities, accelerator cluster management, production serving infrastructure, developer tooling, data pipelines, and networking. It’s a lot of surface area, and the demands on it are growing fast.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We’re hiring a TPM leader to own program management across this whole ecosystem from compute supply through to production workloads. Today, there are a few TPMs working in these areas but no dedicated TPM team, and you will build it. We’re bringing up new datacenters, scaling multi-cloud compute across AWS, GCP, and Azure, managing datacenter construction, and building the software infrastructure to keep pace. The team is currently small but expected to grow very quickly, and we’re looking for a senior leader with experience at scale to build and scale this team to support Anthropic’s rapid growth. You’ll report to the Head of TPM, partnering closely with various engineering leaders on technical strategy, roadmapping, and aligning TPM support where it is most impactful.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Expect to spend most of your time as an IC at the start.

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic’s Compute and Infrastructure organizations are responsible for the systems that train our models, serve our products, and support our engineering teams. That includes datacenter operations, capacity planning across cloud providers and our own facilities, accelerator cluster management, production serving infrastructure, developer tooling, data pipelines, and networking. It’s a lot of surface area, and the demands on it are growing fast.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We’re hiring a TPM leader to own program management across this whole ecosystem from compute supply through to production workloads. Today, there are a few TPMs working in these areas but no dedicated TPM team, and you will build it. We’re bringing up new datacenters, scaling multi-cloud compute across AWS, GCP, and Azure, managing datacenter construction, and building the software infrastructure to keep pace. The team is currently small but expected to grow very quickly, and we’re looking for a senior leader with experience at scale to build and scale this team to support Anthropic’s rapid growth. You’ll report to the Head of TPM, partnering closely with various engineering leaders on technical strategy, roadmapping, and aligning TPM support where it is most impactful.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Expect to spend most of your time as an IC at the start. You’ll personally drive 2–3 critical programs while hiring your team in parallel. As the team grows, you’ll shift more toward people leadership, but this is a role where you need to be comfortable doing the work yourself before you can hand it off.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you&#39;ll do:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;h3 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IC Program Leadership (Near-term Focus)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Own and drive 2–3 of the highest-priority programs across compute and infrastructure while you build the team&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Run the actual programs—datacenter bring-up timelines, capacity scaling plans, infrastructure migrations, cross-team reliability efforts, or whatever the most pressing needs are&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build the processes and playbooks as you go—figure out what works by doing it, then codify it for the team&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Earn credibility with engineering leads through solid execution, not just strategy&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Team Building &amp;amp; Development&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build a TPM team largely from scratch: define roles, write JDs, source candidates, close hires&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Set the standard for what good TPM work looks like in this domain through your own output&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Coach and develop TPMs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Transition programs to your team as you hire&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Planning &amp;amp; Prioritization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Work with various engineering leads to identify work that would most benefit from TPM support&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Make real tradeoffs about what to staff vs. what to skip given limited TPM capacity during the build phase&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Maintain portfolio-level visibility across programs—status, risks, dependencies, blockers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Represent the team in planning cycles and leadership reviews&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cross-functional Coordination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Coordinate across Compute, Infrastructure, and partner teams (Research, Product, Security, Finance, Legal) on programs that span organizational boundaries&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Drive alignment on programs that cross the hardware/software line—e.g., capacity plans that feed into training schedules, or efficiency work that spans accelerator kernels and serving systems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Own executive communication on program status, risks, and resource needs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You May Be a Good Fit If You:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have 10+ years of experience in technical program management, with 7+ years directly managing TPMs and ideally some experience leading larger TPM organizations&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have built a team or function from scratch before—you know the difference between hiring for a defined role vs. figuring out what the roles should be&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have scaled TPM teams to support rapidly-growing, fast-moving company environments&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have worked across physical and software infrastructure—datacenters, networking, hardware ops, distributed systems, cloud platforms, developer tooling.

Hands on familiarity with Datadog Agent, Fluent Bit, Vector, or similar.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Proven ability to balance the trade-offs between data utility (completeness, freshness), security (PII/redaction), and cost in real-time streaming pipelines.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience delivering or operating rehydration, tiering, or archive patterns, or adjacent storage lifecycle features.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Proven work on usage aware cost controls like quotas, budgets, or utility scoring, and ability to partner with FinOps to prove ROI.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Comfortable with Kubernetes and large fleet operations, including staged rollouts, automation, and incident safe changes.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Familiar with data protection in pipelines, including PII obfuscation, redaction, tokenization, and compliance workflows.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Excellent communicator who partners well with enterprise admins, security and compliance leaders, SREs, and engineering teams, and who writes crisp PRDs and migration playbooks.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Bonus: open source contributions or ecosystem experience with tools like OpenTelemetry (OTel), New Relic, Cribl, Edge Delta, or Mezmo.

      "description": "&lt;p&gt;As a Product Manager for Telemetry Optimization, you will build the control plane that helps customers decide what observability data to collect, keep, and recall, and how to manage agents at scale. You will pair cost and risk controls with simple, auditable experiences for administrators and service owners.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You’ll work closely with Platform and SRE teams who face fast growing telemetry volumes, configuration drift across large fleets, and unpredictable bills that create blind spots during incidents. Your customers are central observability owners, enterprise admins, security and compliance partners, and the service teams they support. You’ll own and build guardrails for agent lifecycle, policy, pipelines, routing, and cost that do not break investigations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;At Datadog, we place value in our office culture - the relationships and collaboration it builds and the creativity it brings to the table. We operate as a hybrid workplace to ensure our Datadogs can create a work-life harmony that best fits them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What You’ll Do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Own the strategy for a unified governance and fleet control plane that spans agent lifecycle, configuration at scale, upgrades, and policy enforcement. Partner with SRE, Platform, Security, Finance, Product, Support, and GTM.&lt;br&gt;Define success metrics that tie governance to outcomes such as controlled ingest, reduced cardinality, faster investigations, and predictable bills. Publish dashboards and reviews with stakeholders.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ship a visual pipeline and policy experience for sampling, filtering, redaction, enrichment, routing, and retention, with simulation, staged rollout, and audit trails.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Introduce usage aware governance, including utility scoring, team level quotas and budgets, caps, and alerts that align cost with value.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Enable source side optimization, including edge processing and pre-aggregation, with measurable reduction targets and clear ROI.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Provide APIs and tooling so customers can integrate fleet and pipeline changes into CI or automation workflows, including safe approvals.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ensure secure, auditable operations with role based access to fleet actions like configuration changes, upgrades, and troubleshooting. Establish least privilege defaults.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Support customers using Datadog Agents, OTel collectors or Observability Pipelines. Promote standards pragmatically where they reduce friction.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Partner with Sales, Solutions, Marketing, Finance, Legal, and Support on rollouts, pricing inputs, enablement, and customer adoption.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who You Are&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;6+ years as a Product Manager in data platforms, observability, or adjacent infrastructure. Experience owning agent lifecycle and configuration at large scale.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Strong understanding of telemetry signals and pipelines. Hands on familiarity with Datadog Agent, Fluent Bit, Vector, or similar.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Proven ability to balance the trade-offs between data utility (completeness, freshness), security (PII/redaction), and cost in real-time streaming pipelines.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience delivering or operating rehydration, tiering, or archive patterns, or adjacent storage lifecycle features.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Proven work on usage aware cost controls like quotas, budgets, or utility scoring, and ability to partner with FinOps to prove ROI.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Comfortable with Kubernetes and large fleet operations, including staged rollouts, automation, and incident safe changes.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Familiar with data protection in pipelines, including PII obfuscation, redaction, tokenization, and compliance workflows.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Excellent communicator who partners well with enterprise admins, security and compliance leaders, SREs, and engineering teams, and who writes crisp PRDs and migration playbooks.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Bonus: open source contributions or ecosystem experience with tools like OpenTelemetry (OTel), New Relic, Cribl, Edge Delta, or Mezmo. Experience with CI integrations and major clouds.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Datadog values people from all walks of life.

Since the project, we&#39;ve provided services to more than 425 local government election websites in 33 states.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.1.1.1/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.1.1.1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;: We released&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.1.1.1/&quot;&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;1.1.1.1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver.

However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day.

At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco.

However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

This is a high-stakes, high-visibility role at the center of our business strategy, where experimentation, subscription dynamics, and product development converge. You will work closely with Monetization product and engineering leadership, the finance team, and senior company executives to produce forecasts that are not only accurate but explainable, trusted, and decision-ready.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are looking for someone who deeply understands the statistical and strategic challenges of modeling constantly evolving consumer subscription products. You will need to separate signal from noise, lead investigations when reality diverges from prediction, clearly communicate the business and product impacts of modeling outcomes, and give senior leaders confidence in your numbers when the stakes are high.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:brain:&amp;nbsp; You will...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lead the financial forecasting system.&lt;/strong&gt; Drive methodology, implementation, maintenance, and delivery as the technical owner of our revenue forecasting stack, in close partnership with the finance team. Publish forecasts that serve as the source of truth for company-wide planning and investor-facing decisions.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Model subscription + experimentation dynamics. &lt;/strong&gt;Develop modeling architectures that account for experimental lift, cohort behavior, seasonality, and more, making it clear what’s real impact and what’s noise across the hundreds of experiments Duolingo runs each quarter.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investigate deviations and lead with insight. &lt;/strong&gt;When forecasts miss, lead the root-cause analysis by quantifying drivers of over- or under-performance (e.g. product changes, user behavior shifts, macro trends), collaborating across functions, and clearly communicating what happened and why to senior leadership. Build and be responsible for the statistics, tools, and dashboards that scale these insights across the company.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advance the technical frontier. &lt;/strong&gt;Push our evolution beyond traditional time-series extrapolation and toward more sophisticated approaches such as cohort-based forecasting, retention chaining, and/or causal impact modeling, grounded in business realism and model interpretability.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mentor and influence. &lt;/strong&gt;Serve as a technical mentor to data scientists across the organization, set a high standard for modeling, communication, and statistical rigor, and develop roadmaps for forecasting infrastructure and innovation.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:check:&amp;nbsp; You have...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forecasting domain expertise&lt;/strong&gt;. 6+ years of proven experience building production-grade forecasting systems, with deep applied knowledge of subscription models and understanding of churn dynamics, cohort behaviors, and retention curves.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advanced technical and statistical skills. &lt;/strong&gt;Advanced degree (Masters or PhD) in Data Science, Economics, Statistics, or a related quantitative field with experience assessing and applying theoretical approaches in real-world situations (ex. when to use Bayesian structural models, when causal inference is vital, when a robust heuristic is better than over-fitting noise, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Executive communication&lt;/strong&gt;. Experience distilling uncertainty, nuance, and model tradeoffs into streamlined, actionable narratives for finance and senior leadership partners. Ability to communicate complex forecasting logic clearly and stand by your work in moments of ambiguity.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collaborative style. &lt;/strong&gt;Track record of collaboration across technical and non-technical teams, with a consistent record of integrating feedback, aligning across functions, and operating with a strong sense of ownership and service.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Business responsiveness. &lt;/strong&gt;Strong judgment when balancing model complexity, interpretability, and speed of development, sometimes sacrificing exactness for interpretability. Adapt quickly to fast-paced product and business changes and make model tradeoffs accordingly.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Code quality and reproducibility.&lt;/strong&gt; Expertise writing clean, well-documented code in Python and SQL, and building reliable, multipurpose production pipelines.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experience in high-experimentation environments.&lt;/strong&gt; Past work in organizations where A/B testing is constant, complicating training data and historical baselines.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We post a multi-level salary range for all of our roles.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is not inclusive of the rest of our awesome portfolio that includes equity compensation and world-class benefits.

You’ll have limitless learning opportunities and daily collaborations with world-class minds — while doing work that’s both meaningful and fun.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Join our life-changing mission to develop education for our half a billion (and growing!) learners around the world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Read &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.duolingo.com/?utm_source=greenhouse.com&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=generalblog_gh_091224&quot;&gt;our blog&lt;/a&gt; to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Duolingo is seeking a Staff Data Scientist to own and evolve our most critical financial forecasting systems. This is a high-stakes, high-visibility role at the center of our business strategy, where experimentation, subscription dynamics, and product development converge. You will work closely with Monetization product and engineering leadership, the finance team, and senior company executives to produce forecasts that are not only accurate but explainable, trusted, and decision-ready.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are looking for someone who deeply understands the statistical and strategic challenges of modeling constantly evolving consumer subscription products. You will need to separate signal from noise, lead investigations when reality diverges from prediction, clearly communicate the business and product impacts of modeling outcomes, and give senior leaders confidence in your numbers when the stakes are high.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:brain:&amp;nbsp; You will...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lead the financial forecasting system.&lt;/strong&gt; Drive methodology, implementation, maintenance, and delivery as the technical owner of our revenue forecasting stack, in close partnership with the finance team. Publish forecasts that serve as the source of truth for company-wide planning and investor-facing decisions.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Model subscription + experimentation dynamics. &lt;/strong&gt;Develop modeling architectures that account for experimental lift, cohort behavior, seasonality, and more, making it clear what’s real impact and what’s noise across the hundreds of experiments Duolingo runs each quarter.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investigate deviations and lead with insight. &lt;/strong&gt;When forecasts miss, lead the root-cause analysis by quantifying drivers of over- or under-performance (e.g. product changes, user behavior shifts, macro trends), collaborating across functions, and clearly communicating what happened and why to senior leadership. Build and be responsible for the statistics, tools, and dashboards that scale these insights across the company.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advance the technical frontier. &lt;/strong&gt;Push our evolution beyond traditional time-series extrapolation and toward more sophisticated approaches such as cohort-based forecasting, retention chaining, and/or causal impact modeling, grounded in business realism and model interpretability.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mentor and influence. &lt;/strong&gt;Serve as a technical mentor to data scientists across the organization, set a high standard for modeling, communication, and statistical rigor, and develop roadmaps for forecasting infrastructure and innovation.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:check:&amp;nbsp; You have...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forecasting domain expertise&lt;/strong&gt;. 6+ years of proven experience building production-grade forecasting systems, with deep applied knowledge of subscription models and understanding of churn dynamics, cohort behaviors, and retention curves.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advanced technical and statistical skills. &lt;/strong&gt;Advanced degree (Masters or PhD) in Data Science, Economics, Statistics, or a related quantitative field with experience assessing and applying theoretical approaches in real-world situations (ex. when to use Bayesian structural models, when causal inference is vital, when a robust heuristic is better than over-fitting noise, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Executive communication&lt;/strong&gt;. Experience distilling uncertainty, nuance, and model tradeoffs into streamlined, actionable narratives for finance and senior leadership partners. Ability to communicate complex forecasting logic clearly and stand by your work in moments of ambiguity.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collaborative style. &lt;/strong&gt;Track record of collaboration across technical and non-technical teams, with a consistent record of integrating feedback, aligning across functions, and operating with a strong sense of ownership and service.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Business responsiveness. &lt;/strong&gt;Strong judgment when balancing model complexity, interpretability, and speed of development, sometimes sacrificing exactness for interpretability. Adapt quickly to fast-paced product and business changes and make model tradeoffs accordingly.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Code quality and reproducibility.&lt;/strong&gt; Expertise writing clean, well-documented code in Python and SQL, and building reliable, multipurpose production pipelines.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experience in high-experimentation environments.&lt;/strong&gt; Past work in organizations where A/B testing is constant, complicating training data and historical baselines.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We post a multi-level salary range for all of our roles.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is not inclusive of the rest of our awesome portfolio that includes equity compensation and world-class benefits.

However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day.

At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco.

You’ll determine what to build, what to extend, and what to replace as needs evolve&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Build AI-augmented pipelines for content generation, real-time adaptation, assessment delivery, and quality assurance — working closely with the education team to understand what these systems need to do pedagogically&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Design platform capabilities that enable genuinely new kinds of empowering learning experiences — adaptive paths, competency-based progression, AI-evaluated demonstrations of skill — not just digital versions of traditional courses&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Interface with Anthropic&#39;s security, infrastructure, and data teams to ensure education systems meet organizational standards and integrate cleanly with existing architecture&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Build platform abstractions that let non-engineers on the team configure, extend, and experiment with educational experiences without engineering bottlenecks&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Make product-level decisions about how the platform works — you&#39;re shaping what the learning experience is, not just serving it&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You may be a good fit if you have:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;7+ years of software engineering experience, with demonstrated ability to take a platform from zero to production at scale&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Genuine passion for education — you think about how people learn, you have opinions about what educational technology should look like in an AI-native world, and you want to build it&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A strong eye for quality educational content, with a sense of the complex systems that produce it&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Full-stack engineering skills with particular strength in backend systems: databases, APIs, authentication, reliability, and infrastructure&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Experience building and operating platforms that serve many concurrent users reliably&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Comfort with ambiguity and ownership: you&#39;ll need to translate pedagogical intent into technical architecture without heavy specification&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Experience interfacing with security and infrastructure teams to meet organizational requirements while maintaining development velocity&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A working practice of using AI tools in your own engineering workflows — and genuine curiosity about how AI fundamentally changes what educational platforms can be&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong candidates may also have:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Experience building or significantly contributing to learning platforms, credentialing systems, or educational technology products&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Background in or exposure to learning science, instructional design, or educational research&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Experience with SSO/identity (SAML, OAuth), badging standards (Open Badges), or LTI integrations&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Familiarity with building systems that incorporate LLM capabilities as core infrastructure&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Prior work at a high-growth company where you built platform infrastructure that other teams depended on&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Experience designing systems that non-technical users configure and operate&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The annual compensation range for this role is listed below.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (&quot;OTE&quot;) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Annual Salary:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-range&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$300,000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;divider&quot;&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;$405,000 USD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logistics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education requirements: &lt;/strong&gt;We require at least a Bachelor&#39;s degree in a related field or equivalent experience.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Location-based hybrid policy:&lt;/strong&gt; Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is looking for an Enterprise Communications Manager to drive communications strategy and execution across our enterprise business. This is a central role in how Anthropic shows up with enterprise customers, partners, and buyers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is the top AI company for enterprises. Your job is to sharpen and scale it the communications program. The role spans the full breadth of enterprise communications: product launches translated for business audiences, vertical narratives for industries like financial services and healthcare, partnership and customer announcements, executive thought leadership, competitive positioning, and content that speaks to CIOs, CFOs, and CISOs and millions of business users. You&#39;ll coordinate tightly with sales, partnerships, marketing, analyst relations, product, and others.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a fast-paced and lean team, so you need to be as comfortable building repeatable playbooks as you are crafting a narrative. The best candidate comes from an AI communications background and brings deep experience across multiple enterprise comms disciplines — product, vertical, partner, customer, and executive communications — understands how large organizations evaluate technology, and can develop a messaging framework in the morning and turn around a press release by end of day.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key focus areas:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Product and launch communications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Develop

relationships with enterprise technology, business, and industry media&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Coordinate with sales, partnerships, product marketing, and international teams to keep messaging aligned

degree in a related field or equivalent experience.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Location-based hybrid policy:&lt;/strong&gt; Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day.

At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 18pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Role:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The U.S. healthcare system wastes hundreds of billions of dollars a year on administrative complexity—the friction between payers, providers, and the systems that connect them. We believe AI can materially reduce that waste, and we’re building the products to do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We’re looking for someone to own this effort. As the product lead for Healthcare, you will be Anthropic’s healthcare leader—setting strategy, shipping products, and serving as the company’s voice in one of the most consequential industries AI will transform. You’ll work across product, engineering, research, go-to-market, policy, and safety to build a healthcare business from early momentum into a scaled vertical.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a 0→1 role. It will be your job to take ownership, sharpen the plan, and drive execution. The scope is broad—healthcare touches nearly every function at the company—and you need to be the kind of person who thrives catching all the balls, triaging what matters, and making sure nothing important falls through the cracks. Low ego, high accountability.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 18pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Own Anthropic’s healthcare strategy end-to-end. You are the DRI, accountable for the plan, the priorities, and the results.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build and ship AI products that address high-value workflows across the payer, provider, and health tech ecosystem. Identify where the biggest pain is, define what to build, and drive it to market.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Be Anthropic’s healthcare leader externally. When a customer, partner, regulator, government agency, or journalist wants to talk to Anthropic about healthcare, you take the meeting. You’re credible, prepared, and trusted.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Triage and coordinate the many cross-functional threads that healthcare creates across the company—product, research, engineering, applied AI, sales, safety, policy, legal, and compliance. Find a home for everything and make sure it moves forward.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Define the product and research roadmap in close partnership with engineering and research teams. You don’t need to lead research day-to-day, but you need sharp instincts about where the model falls short in healthcare contexts and the ability to work with the right teams to close those gaps.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Drive regulatory readiness—including HIPAA compliance—across Anthropic’s products as they serve healthcare customers.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build relationships with strategic customers and partners. Translate what you learn from the market into product priorities, data partnerships, and go-to-market strategy.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 18pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You May Be a Good Fit If:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You’ve spent meaningful time inside the healthcare industry. You’ve worked deeply with payers, providers, or health tech companies and you know how the system actually works: the regulations, the incentives, the operational realities, and where the real inefficiencies live.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You have 10+ years of experience in healthcare, with a significant portion spent close to administrative workflows, revenue cycle, payer operations, or the technology that supports them.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You’ve built products or businesses from scratch (0→1) in complex, regulated environments. You know what it takes to go from ambiguity to a shipped product with real customers.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You have strong cross-functional instincts and genuine willingness to do the work. This role involves as much coordination, follow-through, and unglamorous problem-solving as it does strategy. You are not above any task.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You have strong product judgment and enough technical fluency to engage meaningfully with engineers and researchers on tradeoffs—without needing to be the most technical person in the room. You know when the model isn’t good enough for a given use case and can articulate what “better” looks like.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You communicate exceptionally well. You can translate between the languages of AI capabilities, healthcare operations, regulatory requirements, and business outcomes with equal comfort.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You have experience navigating HIPAA, CMS regulations, or other healthcare compliance frameworks and understand what it takes to ship products in heavily regulated industries.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 18pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Healthcare is one of the largest and most important industries in the world, and it’s on the cusp of a generational technology shift. Anthropic is building the most capable and safety-focused AI in the industry, and this role puts you at the center of bringing that technology to the sector where it can do the most good. You’ll have the autonomy to define strategy, the mandate to ship products, and the backing of a world-class team across research, engineering, and go-to-market.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you’re the kind of person who wants to build something that matters—and has the healthcare expertise and entrepreneurial drive to actually pull it off—we want to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The annual compensation range for this role is listed below.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (&quot;OTE&quot;) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Annual Salary:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-range&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$485,000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;divider&quot;&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;$645,000 USD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logistics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education requirements: &lt;/strong&gt;We require at least a Bachelor&#39;s degree in a related field or equivalent experience.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Location-based hybrid policy:&lt;/strong&gt; Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day.

At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

While you’ll collaborate closely with senior leaders and external partners, this is a hands-on ownership role for someone who likes to be in the details and accountable for outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a full time role that can be held from our San Francisco Hub.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;What you’ll do at Figma:&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Own and lead the global real estate portfolio end to end — from strategy and site selection to lease negotiations, renewals, expansions, and exits — ensuring alignment with business needs and growth plans&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Lead all major facility projects and office buildouts, managing scope, budgets, timelines, vendors, and day-to-day execution from concept through move-in&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Design scalable systems, processes, and documentation for how we evaluate space, manage leases, run projects, and operate offices across regions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Manage the operational details of real estate and facilities work — contracts, approvals, documentation, timelines, risks, and communications — ensuring nothing slips through the cracks&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Partner cross-functionally with Finance, Legal, Workplace, Security, People, and business leaders to align real estate decisions with broader company priorities&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build and maintain real estate financial models and scenarios (e.g., total cost of occupancy, capex/opex tradeoffs) to support clear, data-informed decision-making&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Communicate clearly and confidently with senior leaders and the C-suite, translating complex real estate considerations into actionable recommendations&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Continuously evolve how we approach real estate and facilities to support a fast-growing, global company — balancing speed, quality, cost, and employee experience&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;section page-centered&quot;&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;We&#39;d love to hear from you if you have:&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li data-start=&quot;143&quot; data-end=&quot;331&quot;&gt;7+ years of experience in active real estate or facilities management, with direct ownership of leases, negotiations, and buildout projects across domestic and international markets&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li data-start=&quot;334&quot; data-end=&quot;459&quot;&gt;Strong fluency in real estate financials, with the ability to model, explain, and evaluate costs, tradeoffs, and risks&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li data-start=&quot;462&quot; data-end=&quot;573&quot;&gt;High ownership mindset and attention to detail — you take things end-to-end and ensure they get finished&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li data-start=&quot;576&quot; data-end=&quot;739&quot;&gt;Comfort operating in ambiguity, bringing structure, systems, and scalable processes to fast-moving environments while supporting a great employee experience&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li data-start=&quot;742&quot; data-end=&quot;882&quot;&gt;Clear, thoughtful communicator and cross-functional partner, able to influence stakeholders and senior leaders without formal authority&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;While not required, it’s an added plus if you also have:&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience supporting high-growth tech companies or startups&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Overseen real estate portfolios across multiple regions simultaneously&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have a background in facilities operations or workplace experience&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Enjoy building templates, playbooks, dashboards, and repeatable workflows from scratch&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience managing vendors and negotiations in complex or unfamiliar markets&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;section page-centered&quot;&gt;At Figma, one of our values is Grow as you go.

However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day.

At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;text-accent-secondary-100 underline&quot; href=&quot;http://Claude.ai&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Claude.ai&lt;/a&gt; is Anthropic&#39;s flagship consumer product, spanning web, mobile, desktop, and browser extensions—and it&#39;s growing fast. We&#39;re looking for an engineering leader to own the foundational platform that powers all of these surfaces: the shared infrastructure, APIs, tooling, and systems that enable product teams to ship reliably, quickly, and with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In this role, you&#39;ll lead the team responsible for reliability, latency, developer velocity, and common components across &lt;a class=&quot;text-accent-secondary-100 underline&quot; href=&quot;http://Claude.ai&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Claude.ai&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s UI surfaces. This includes the backend-for-frontend (BFF) APIs that power our client applications. Your work will directly determine how fast customer, partner, and product teams can innovate—and how stable their experiences are when they ship. This is a highly technical leadership role: you&#39;ll stay close to the code, drive architectural decisions, and build the systems that let others move faster.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a unique opportunity to shape the developer experience and platform foundations for one of the most rapidly evolving AI products in the world. You&#39;ll partner closely with product engineering teams, infrastructure, and leadership to ensure &lt;a class=&quot;text-accent-secondary-100 underline&quot; href=&quot;http://Claude.ai&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Claude.ai&lt;/a&gt; scales gracefully as we grow.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Lead and grow the UI Platform team, setting technical direction for reliability, performance, and developer experience across all &lt;a class=&quot;text-accent-secondary-100 underline&quot;

href=&quot;http://Claude.ai&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Claude.ai&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s client applications, ensuring clean abstractions and reliable contracts for product teams&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Drive improvements to developer velocity—reducing friction, improving tooling, and enabling teams to ship features faster and more safely&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Establish and maintain high standards for latency, reliability, and quality across the platform&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Partner closely with product engineering, infrastructure, and leadership to align platform investments with product priorities&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Create clarity and direction in a fast-moving, ambiguous environment where priorities shift as &lt;a class=&quot;text-accent-secondary-100 underline&quot;

Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

      "description": "&lt;div class=&quot;content-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discord is used by over 200 million people every month for many different reasons, but there’s one thing that nearly everyone does on our platform:&lt;strong&gt; play video games.&lt;/strong&gt; Over 90% of our users play games, spending a combined 1.5 billion hours playing thousands of unique titles on Discord each month. Discord plays a uniquely important role in the future of gaming. We are focused on making it easier and more fun for people to talk and hang out before, during, and after playing games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our Web Platform team is responsible for building and maintaining the critical systems that power Discord&#39;s frontend development across web, desktop, and mobile platforms. These systems support hundreds of engineers daily, process thousands of builds and deployments, and enable rapid feature delivery through robust tooling infrastructure. Through developing and operating foundational JavaScript build systems - including linters, bundlers, package managers, and CI/CD automation - our work allows internal developers to ship features quickly and safely while ensuring optimal performance, correctness, and developer ergonomics. This team also owns the localization and translation systems that power the strings and copy found across all of our apps and platforms.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a Senior Software Engineer on this team, you will continuously improve our build tooling, developer workflows, and infrastructure - affecting the productivity of every frontend engineer at Discord and ultimately every user interaction on the platform!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What You&#39;ll Be Doing:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Building and maintaining the tools, pipelines, and processes that keep frontend development at Discord fast, safe, and reliable.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Becoming an expert in JavaScript tooling and serving as a resource to help teams solve any and all problems they encounter during development.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Refactoring and upgrading the codebase to pay down tech debt, keep up with the state of the art in web development, and drive progress toward better maintainability.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Writing new and unique tools based on the specific needs of Discord’s frontend projects to make everything Just Work.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Digging deep into bundlers, linters, formatters, editor plugins, and more to optimize their performance, adopt and test new features early on, and continuously improve the experience for the developers using them.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you have:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;3+ years of working with JavaScript tools and the Node.js ecosystem.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with and a desire to work across multiple programming languages (generally including JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Rust, Kotlin, Go, and Swift).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience developing and maintaining CLI tools and packages in JavaScript.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A strong sense for writing maintainable code and deliberately documenting for the future.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Understanding of all of the tools involved in frontend development and how they work together.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus Points:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Familiarity and experience with localization in frontend applications.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with React Native, related tools (Metro, Hermes), and bridging between JavaScript and native code.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience with directly maintaining or writing plugins for tools like bundlers, linters, or formatters in any language.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience with CI/CD orchestration, Cloudflare workers, cloud storage providers, and other application deployment processes.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Candidates must reside in or be willing to relocate to the San Francisco Bay Area (Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, Napa, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Solano, and Sonoma counties). Relocation assistance may be available.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The US base salary range for this full-time position is $196,000 to $220,500 + equity + benefits. Our salary ranges are determined by role and level. Within the range, individual pay is determined by additional factors, including job-related skills, experience, and relevant education or training.

This role focuses on enabling users to &lt;em&gt;find, explore, and act&lt;/em&gt; on observability and security data using AI-powered semantic understanding rather than rigid query syntax or navigation paths.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As Datadog continues to expand in breadth and depth, discovering the right data, services, insights, or actions becomes increasingly complex.

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are seeking a GRC Automation Lead to join our GRC organization and build the technical foundation for how we scale our risk and compliance programs. In this role, you will lead the team that designs and implements automated workflows, data pipelines, and integrations that transform manual compliance processes into scalable engineering systems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a greenfield opportunity to establish the team, architecture, and integrations that will define how we approach governance, risk, and compliance at Anthropic. The core challenge is a data problem: compliance information lives across dozens of systems—cloud infrastructure, identity providers, HR platforms, ticketing tools, code repositories—and your job is to design systems that bring it together, normalize it, and make it actionable. Success in this role comes from understanding how systems connect and how data flows between them, not from writing code yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At Anthropic, you&#39;ll also have a unique advantage: the ability to design AI-powered workflows where Claude acts as an extension of your team, handling tasks that would traditionally require additional headcount or manual effort. You&#39;ll need ingenuity to identify where agentic AI can accelerate evidence collection, interpret unstructured data, triage compliance gaps, and augment human judgment in risk assessments. Working closely with Security, IT, and Engineering teams, you&#39;ll translate compliance and regulatory requirements into solutions that support audit programs including SOC 2, ISO, HIPAA, and FedRAMP, building systems that combine traditional automation with AI capabilities to achieve scale that wouldn&#39;t otherwise be possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Responsibilities:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Lead the team that establishes foundational GRC processes and architecture. Design and build automated workflows for risk management and compliance, creating scalable systems that enable continuous monitoring as Anthropic grows.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build data pipelines that aggregate risk, control, and asset information from across our technology stack. This means solving hard data integration problems: mapping disparate schemas, handling inconsistent data quality, and creating unified views of compliance posture through dashboards and reporting tools.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Inform GRC platform strategy and implementation: in partnership with other programs, evaluate, select, and deploy tooling that meets our compliance requirements.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Translate written policies and compliance requirements into policy-as-code—working with Engineering and Security teams to express requirements as enforceable rules, automated checks, and continuous validation rather than static documents.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Establish feedback loops between policy and implementation: surface where technical controls diverge from written requirements, identify where policies need to evolve based on infrastructure realities, and ensure that compliance requirements are expressed in terms engineers can act on.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Design and deploy agentic AI workflows that extend team capacity, using Claude to automate evidence analysis, monitor control effectiveness, draft audit responses, interpret policy documents, and handle other tasks that require reasoning over unstructured information.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Design and maintain integrations connecting GRC tooling with cloud infrastructure, identity management systems, HRIS platforms, ticketing systems, version control, and CI/CD pipelines—working with engineers to implement integrations that enable automated evidence collection and continuous compliance validation.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build and lead the GRC Automation function as we scale: hiring team members, establishing practices, and defining the technical roadmap for governance and compliance automation at Anthropic.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;You may be a good fit if you:&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have 3-4+ years of experience managing technical individual contributors or systems-focused teams, with a proven track record of building or scaling small teams (2-5 people) in security, compliance, automation, or operations functions.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are a systems thinker first. You understand how complex environments work: how data flows between systems, where integration points exist, what breaks when systems don&#39;t talk to each other.

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are seeking a GRC Automation Lead to join our GRC organization and build the technical foundation for how we scale our risk and compliance programs. In this role, you will lead the team that designs and implements automated workflows, data pipelines, and integrations that transform manual compliance processes into scalable engineering systems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a greenfield opportunity to establish the team, architecture, and integrations that will define how we approach governance, risk, and compliance at Anthropic. The core challenge is a data problem: compliance information lives across dozens of systems—cloud infrastructure, identity providers, HR platforms, ticketing tools, code repositories—and your job is to design systems that bring it together, normalize it, and make it actionable. Success in this role comes from understanding how systems connect and how data flows between them, not from writing code yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At Anthropic, you&#39;ll also have a unique advantage: the ability to design AI-powered workflows where Claude acts as an extension of your team, handling tasks that would traditionally require additional headcount or manual effort. You&#39;ll need ingenuity to identify where agentic AI can accelerate evidence collection, interpret unstructured data, triage compliance gaps, and augment human judgment in risk assessments. Working closely with Security, IT, and Engineering teams, you&#39;ll translate compliance and regulatory requirements into solutions that support audit programs including SOC 2, ISO, HIPAA, and FedRAMP, building systems that combine traditional automation with AI capabilities to achieve scale that wouldn&#39;t otherwise be possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Responsibilities:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Lead the team that establishes foundational GRC processes and architecture. Design and build automated workflows for risk management and compliance, creating scalable systems that enable continuous monitoring as Anthropic grows.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build data pipelines that aggregate risk, control, and asset information from across our technology stack. This means solving hard data integration problems: mapping disparate schemas, handling inconsistent data quality, and creating unified views of compliance posture through dashboards and reporting tools.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Inform GRC platform strategy and implementation: in partnership with other programs, evaluate, select, and deploy tooling that meets our compliance requirements.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Translate written policies and compliance requirements into policy-as-code—working with Engineering and Security teams to express requirements as enforceable rules, automated checks, and continuous validation rather than static documents.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Establish feedback loops between policy and implementation: surface where technical controls diverge from written requirements, identify where policies need to evolve based on infrastructure realities, and ensure that compliance requirements are expressed in terms engineers can act on.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Design and deploy agentic AI workflows that extend team capacity, using Claude to automate evidence analysis, monitor control effectiveness, draft audit responses, interpret policy documents, and handle other tasks that require reasoning over unstructured information.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Design and maintain integrations connecting GRC tooling with cloud infrastructure, identity management systems, HRIS platforms, ticketing systems, version control, and CI/CD pipelines—working with engineers to implement integrations that enable automated evidence collection and continuous compliance validation.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build and lead the GRC Automation function as we scale: hiring team members, establishing practices, and defining the technical roadmap for governance and compliance automation at Anthropic.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;You may be a good fit if you:&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have 3-4+ years of experience managing technical individual contributors or systems-focused teams, with a proven track record of building or scaling small teams (2-5 people) in security, compliance, automation, or operations functions.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are a systems thinker first. You understand how complex environments work: how data flows between systems, where integration points exist, what breaks when systems don&#39;t talk to each other. Your strength is designing the right architecture and environment for security monitoring, not necessarily implementing it yourself.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have 5+ years of experience designing automated workflows, data pipelines, or system integrations, whether through traditional development, low-code platforms, GRC tools, or process automation.

You will work closely with our research and product teams to develop detections, evals, interventions, and tools to measure and mitigate deployment and user risks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are looking for a product manager who is deeply committed to making AI safe and beneficial for humanity.&amp;nbsp; You are aware of the risks and are committed to working with experts and coming up with ideas for Anthropic to implement. You have deep technical expertise in development, deployment and measurement of Safeguards systems. You thrive in rapidly moving and ambiguous environments.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Responsibilities:&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Determine how to build in safety by design upstream and leverage downstream defenses for Anthropic’s frontier models, AI products, customers on different surfaces - Claude.ai, 1P API, external Cloud providers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ability to write safety evals and communicate externally about safety.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Drive impact via ruthless prioritization by clearly defining problems, solution options forward, clarity on both business &amp;amp; technical tradeoffs and accordingly clear requirements toward MVP vs. ideal state.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Align &amp;amp; collaborate with policy, enforcement, research, engineering and cross functional stakeholders.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Understand the AI landscape and ecosystem to plan for mitigation of deployment risks of increasingly powerful models and determined adversaries.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Lead the development of metrics to understand the area, performance, blindspots to help inform future project planning.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;You may be a good fit if you have:&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;5+ years in product management with a focus on fast problem understanding, building roadmaps with tractable progress, ability to get into the details on data, detection &amp;amp; interventions, infrastructure &amp;amp; tools, and/or evals.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ability to make technical tradeoff decisions; ideally with experience working across policy experts, AI/ML research engineers and software engineering teams to design and build state of the art safety systems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Strong user understanding of how our products are used, their Safeguards concerns and how we provide the best solutions.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Demonstrated ability to build product and engineering strategy across multiple cross-functional teams for a rapidly changing space.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Demonstrated experience in designing and building metrics to evaluate risks, system performance, user impact and making crisp tradeoffs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Very strong ability to navigate, and prioritize amidst rapidly changing product specs, and to flex into different domains to bring clarity and execute.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Evidence of exercising judgment and decision making in ambiguous situations.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Planning, building, launching and measuring new products / systems in a zero to one environment.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ability to clearly articulate complex technical concepts to non-technical audiences in written and verbal communication.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Think creatively about the risks and benefits of new technologies, and think beyond past checklists and playbooks.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The annual compensation range for this role is listed below.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (&quot;OTE&quot;) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Annual Salary:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-range&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$305,000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;divider&quot;&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;$385,000 USD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logistics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education requirements: &lt;/strong&gt;We require at least a Bachelor&#39;s degree in a related field or equivalent experience.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Location-based hybrid policy:&lt;/strong&gt; Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;About the role&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a Segment Marketing Manager for Financial Services &amp;amp; Insurance at Anthropic, you will own the end-to-end demand marketing strategy for one of the most consequential verticals in our go-to-market motion. Financial services and insurance organizations are among the earliest adopters of enterprise AI, and this role sits at the intersection of deep industry expertise and Anthropic&#39;s mission to build safe, reliable AI systems that deliver real business value.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You&#39;ll be responsible for developing and executing industry campaigns, ABM, and targeted marketing programs that drive awareness, pipeline, and adoption of Claude and Anthropic&#39;s API among financial institutions, insurers, and related firms. This means deeply understanding the unique challenges, regulatory landscape, and decision-making dynamics of this segment — and translating that understanding into campaigns, content, and experiences that resonate with technical and business stakeholders alike.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is an ideal opportunity for someone who thrives at the intersection of strategic thinking and hands-on execution, and who is energized by the challenge of bringing frontier AI technology to an industry where trust, compliance, and reliability are non-negotiable.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2

vertical&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Build a deep understanding of the competitive landscape, buyer personas, and AI adoption patterns specific to financial services and insurance,

leadership pieces, and enablement materials that speak to the priorities and pain points of this industry&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Collaborate cross-functionally with product, sales, communications, design, and research teams to ensure marketing efforts are aligned with product capabilities and business objectives&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Design and

processes that are common in financial services organizations&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Are skilled at translating complex technical capabilities into compelling, audience-specific

In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day.

At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco.

But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

      "description": "&lt;div class=&quot;content-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discord is used by over 200 million people every month for many different reasons, but there’s one thing that nearly everyone does on our platform:&lt;strong&gt; play video games.&lt;/strong&gt; Over 90% of our users play games, spending a combined 1.5 billion hours playing thousands of unique titles on Discord each month. Discord plays a uniquely important role in the future of gaming. We are focused on making it easier and more fun for people to talk and hang out before, during, and after playing games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Discord is looking for an experienced, technical, and mission-driven Director of Security Operations to lead our Detection &amp;amp; Response, Enterprise Security, Identity &amp;amp; Access Management, and Cyber Threat Intelligence teams. You will report directly to the Head of Security and will be instrumental in defining and executing our security operations strategy while building world-class teams that protect Discord and our users.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This role owns four security domains and requires a leader who can operate with minimal direction, drive long-term strategy, and deliver results across complex, high-stakes environments. As a senior member of the Security leadership team, you&#39;ll serve as a key succession candidate for greater organizational responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a technical leadership role. Security at Discord is an engineering discipline, and we expect leaders at all levels to stay close to the work. You won&#39;t be writing production code daily, but you should be comfortable reading code, writing scripts, and digging into technical details when the situation demands it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you&#39;ll be doing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategy &amp;amp; Vision&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Define and own the unified security operations strategy spanning Detection &amp;amp; Response, IT Security, Identity &amp;amp; Access Management, and Cyber Threat Intelligence—ensuring alignment across domains while respecting their distinct missions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Formalize and expand Discord&#39;s Cyber Threat Intelligence function: mature existing capabilities into a structured program, build the team, establish collection and production processes, and integrate intelligence into security operations and business decision-making&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Own the identity and access management strategy across Discord—covering corporate systems, cloud infrastructure environments, and the policies and controls that govern access to both&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Collaborate with Security, Engineering, IT, Legal, Trust &amp;amp; Safety, and executive leadership to align security operations priorities with company goals&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Own accountability for security operations outcomes across all four domains, ensuring success criteria are effectively measured and achieved&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical Leadership&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Maintain enough technical depth across your domains to effectively evaluate proposals, challenge assumptions, and hold teams accountable for sound technical decisions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Get hands-on when needed: review detection logic, dig into incident forensics, audit IAM configurations, or prototype solutions when it accelerates the team&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Drive engineering excellence across security operations—ensuring teams build reliable, automated, and scalable solutions rather than manual processes that don&#39;t scale&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organizational Leadership&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build, lead, and scale a high-performing organization of security professionals across four functions with varying maturity levels, each requiring different leadership approaches&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Design a healthy organization structure that balances operational excellence, innovation, and speed&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Drive the full talent lifecycle: hiring, culture-building, growth, performance management, and retention&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Grow and develop managers who can effectively own their domains with increasing autonomy; maintain a clear succession plan and build bench strength across the organization&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Establish operational rhythms, cross-team rituals, and shared practices that create cohesion while preserving domain expertise&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cross-Functional Partnership&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Partner with Security Engineering leadership to ensure detection, response, IAM, and threat intelligence capabilities are informed by and integrated with product and infrastructure security efforts&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Drive alignment between IT Security, IAM, and enterprise technology decisions—ensuring security is embedded in how Discord operates, not bolted on&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ensure threat intelligence is actionable: inform detection engineering priorities, support incident investigations, and provide strategic context to Security and company leadership&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Executive Communication &amp;amp; Crisis Leadership&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Serve as a trusted advisor to leadership on security operations risks, incidents, threat landscape, and program health&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Provide executive-level visibility into security operations posture, investment needs, and key risks&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Translate threat intelligence into business-relevant context for leadership and cross-functional partners&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Act as an escalation point and decision-maker during significant security incidents; ensure appropriate crisis communication to leadership&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Represent Discord&#39;s security operations externally when appropriate, and build the organization&#39;s reputation through knowledge sharing&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who you are&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You have 10+ years of experience in security, with 5+ years in leadership roles managing multiple teams or managers across different security disciplines&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You are technical: you can read and write code (Python is ideal), review technical designs, and engage with engineers on implementation details&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You have experience maturing a security function: taking something informal or early-stage and building it into a structured, repeatable program&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You consistently reach the right decision and bring people along with you; you act decisively in critical situations, even when making unpopular calls&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You communicate with clarity and conviction to any audience—from engineers to executives—and you understand the weight your title carries in debates&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You thrive with autonomy, operate with minimal editing from your manager, and proactively drive alignment across the organization&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You have led through significant security incidents and understand how to balance speed, thoroughness, and communication under pressure&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You have aspirations for broader leadership responsibility and see this role as a path toward greater organizational impact&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You have deep experience with identity and access management at scale—particularly in cloud-native environments (GCP, AWS)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus Points&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Hands on experience integrating AI systems and tools into Security workflows&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Background in gaming, social platforms, or consumer technology&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with trust &amp;amp; safety operations and their intersection with security&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience building organizations across multiple locations or time zones&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Understanding of threat actors relevant to gaming or social platforms (financially motivated fraud, account takeover, community-targeted harassment campaigns, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Candidates must reside in or be willing to relocate to the San Francisco Bay Area (Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, Napa, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Solano, and Sonoma counties). For this role, the hiring manager would like folks to be in the office 1 day a week. Relocation assistance may be available.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The US base salary range for this full-time position is $400,000 to $450,000 + equity + benefits.

However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day.

At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

Figma’s platform helps teams bring ideas to life—whether you&#39;re brainstorming, creating a prototype, translating designs into code, or iterating with AI. From idea to product, Figma empowers teams to streamline workflows, move faster, and work together in real time from anywhere in the world.

Over the past year, Figma has shifted from teams independently building bespoke, React-based admin tools to a model where dozens of engineering teams build on a shared internal platform that enforces security, privacy, and access controls by default.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As an Engineering Manager on Internal Tools, you’ll lead a team of senior engineers working at the intersection of engineering, operations, and platform strategy. You’ll partner closely with CX (Product Support), Legal, and Program Management to translate shared goals into durable, scalable solutions. While this team works on engineering workflows, the focus is on workflows that operate within the context of Figma’s product and customer environments—enabling teams to support, administer, and debug real customer scenarios—rather than tooling for the software development lifecycle itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This role is ideal for someone who enjoys operating in ambiguous, cross-functional spaces, amplifying the impact of strong ICs, and driving outcomes through platform leverage.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a full time role that can be held from one of our US hubs or remotely in the United States.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you&#39;ll do at Figma:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Lead and support a team of senior engineers building internal platforms and workflows used across Figma&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Provide clear ownership and continuity for complex, cross-functional initiatives that span Product Support, Legal, Program Management, and Engineering&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Reduce cross-organizational coordination overhead so engineers can focus on high-leverage technical work&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Partner deeply with CX (Product Support) to understand desired outcomes and translate them into scalable platform capabilities&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ensure security, privacy, reliability, and operational safety are treated as non-negotiable in all work&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Balance short-term partner needs with long-term platform leverage and sustainability&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Bring clarity and structure to ambiguous problem spaces while maintaining strong delivery discipline&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’d love to hear from you if you have:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience managing senior, high-performing software engineers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A track record of leading complex, cross-functional initiatives without dedicated PM or TPM support&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Strong judgment around prioritization, tradeoffs, and long-term technical sustainability&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience partnering closely with operational teams such as Product Support, Trust &amp;amp; Safety, Legal, or similar&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The ability to lead through influence, build trust with stakeholders, and challenge problem framing constructively&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While it’s not required, it’s an added plus if you also have:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience stewarding shared internal platforms with many downstream consumers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with security- or privacy-sensitive systems and workflows&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience operating in environments with high ambiguity and evolving requirements&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A background in platform, infrastructure, or internal tooling teams&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;section page-centered&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;section page-centered&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;At Figma, one of our values is Grow as you go.

Over the past year, Figma has shifted from teams independently building bespoke, React-based admin tools to a model where dozens of engineering teams build on a shared internal platform that enforces security, privacy, and access controls by default.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As an Engineering Manager on Internal Tools, you’ll lead a team of senior engineers working at the intersection of engineering, operations, and platform strategy. You’ll partner closely with CX (Product Support), Legal, and Program Management to translate shared goals into durable, scalable solutions. While this team works on engineering workflows, the focus is on workflows that operate within the context of Figma’s product and customer environments—enabling teams to support, administer, and debug real customer scenarios—rather than tooling for the software development lifecycle itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This role is ideal for someone who enjoys operating in ambiguous, cross-functional spaces, amplifying the impact of strong ICs, and driving outcomes through platform leverage.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a full time role that can be held from one of our US hubs or remotely in the United States.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you&#39;ll do at Figma:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Lead and support a team of senior engineers building internal platforms and workflows used across Figma&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Provide clear ownership and continuity for complex, cross-functional initiatives that span Product Support, Legal, Program Management, and Engineering&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Reduce cross-organizational coordination overhead so engineers can focus on high-leverage technical work&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Partner deeply with CX (Product Support) to understand desired outcomes and translate them into scalable platform capabilities&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ensure security, privacy, reliability, and operational safety are treated as non-negotiable in all work&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Balance short-term partner needs with long-term platform leverage and sustainability&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Bring clarity and structure to ambiguous problem spaces while maintaining strong delivery discipline&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’d love to hear from you if you have:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience managing senior, high-performing software engineers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A track record of leading complex, cross-functional initiatives without dedicated PM or TPM support&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Strong judgment around prioritization, tradeoffs, and long-term technical sustainability&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience partnering closely with operational teams such as Product Support, Trust &amp;amp; Safety, Legal, or similar&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The ability to lead through influence, build trust with stakeholders, and challenge problem framing constructively&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While it’s not required, it’s an added plus if you also have:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience stewarding shared internal platforms with many downstream consumers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with security- or privacy-sensitive systems and workflows&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience operating in environments with high ambiguity and evolving requirements&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A background in platform, infrastructure, or internal tooling teams&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;section page-centered&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;section page-centered&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;At Figma, one of our values is Grow as you go.

We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day.

At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco.

Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day.

At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

As usage of our AI services grows, we need to ensure they are not misused. The Safeguards team is at the forefront of protecting our users from the risks of powerful AIs as well as ethical, technical, and social risks from the use of generative AI. The Safeguards team at Anthropic builds protections for new AI features enabled by the research teams and protects new products and surfaces developed by our product teams. As a Product Manager for the Safeguards team at Anthropic, you will own the ideation, design, development and deployment of Safeguards systems and relevant product UX to ensure we are advancing frontier models safely to users across various cloud platforms. You will work closely with our research and product teams to develop detections, evals, interventions, and tools to measure and mitigate deployment and user risks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are looking for a product manager who is deeply committed to making AI safe and beneficial for humanity.&amp;nbsp; You are aware of the risks and are committed to working with experts and coming up with ideas for Anthropic to implement. You have deep technical expertise in development, deployment and measurement of Safeguards systems. You thrive in rapidly moving and ambiguous environments.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Responsibilities:&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Determine how to build in safety by design upstream and leverage downstream defenses for Anthropic’s frontier models, AI products, customers on different surfaces - Claude.ai, 1P API, external Cloud providers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ability to write safety evals and communicate externally about safety.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Drive impact via ruthless prioritization by clearly defining problems, solution options forward, clarity on both business &amp;amp; technical tradeoffs and accordingly clear requirements toward MVP vs. ideal state.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Align &amp;amp; collaborate with policy, enforcement, research, engineering and cross functional stakeholders.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Understand the AI landscape and ecosystem to plan for mitigation of deployment risks of increasingly powerful models and determined adversaries.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Lead the development of metrics to understand the area, performance, blindspots to help inform future project planning.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;You may be a good fit if you have:&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;5+ years in product management with a focus on fast problem understanding, building roadmaps with tractable progress, ability to get into the details on data, detection &amp;amp; interventions, infrastructure &amp;amp; tools, and/or evals.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ability to make technical tradeoff decisions; ideally with experience working across policy experts, AI/ML research engineers and software engineering teams to design and build state of the art safety systems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Strong user understanding of how our products are used, their Safeguards concerns and how we provide the best solutions.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Demonstrated ability to build product and engineering strategy across multiple cross-functional teams for a rapidly changing space.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Demonstrated experience in designing and building metrics to evaluate risks, system performance, user impact and making crisp tradeoffs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Very strong ability to navigate, and prioritize amidst rapidly changing product specs, and to flex into different domains to bring clarity and execute.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Evidence of exercising judgment and decision making in ambiguous situations.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Planning, building, launching and measuring new products / systems in a zero to one environment.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ability to clearly articulate complex technical concepts to non-technical audiences in written and verbal communication.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Think creatively about the risks and benefits of new technologies, and think beyond past checklists and playbooks.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The annual compensation range for this role is listed below.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (&quot;OTE&quot;) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Annual Salary:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-range&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$305,000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;divider&quot;&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;$385,000 USD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logistics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education requirements: &lt;/strong&gt;We require at least a Bachelor&#39;s degree in a related field or equivalent experience.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Location-based hybrid policy:&lt;/strong&gt; Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day.

At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research.
