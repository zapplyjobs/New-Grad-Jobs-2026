      "job_description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.Anthropic’s Audio team pushes the boundaries of what's possible with audio with large language models. We care about making safe, steerable, reliable systems that can understand and generate speech and audio, prioritizing not only naturalness but also steerability and robustness. As a researcher on the Audio team, you'll work across the full stack of audio ML, developing audio codecs and representations, sourcing and synthesizing high quality audio data, training large-scale speech language models and large audio diffusion models, and developing novel architectures for incorporating continuous signals into LLMs. Our team focuses primarily but not exclusively on speech, building advanced steerable systems spanning end-to-end conversational systems, speech and audio understanding models, and speech synthesis capabilities. The team works closely with many collaborators across pretraining, finetuning, reinforcement learning, production inference, and product to get advanced audio technologies from early research to high impact real-world deployments. You may be a good fit if you: Have hands-on experience with training audio models, whether that's conversational speech-to-speech, speech translation, speech recognition, text-to-speech, diarization, codecs, or generative audio models Genuinely enjoy both research and engineering work, and you'd describe your ideal split as roughly 50/50 rather than heavily weighted toward one or the other Are comfortable working across abstraction levels, from signal processing fundamentals to large-scale model training and inference optimization Have deep expertise with JAX, PyTorch, or large-scale distributed training, and can debug performance issues across the full stack Thrive in fast-moving environments where the most important problem might shift as we learn more about what works Communicate clearly and collaborate effectively; audio touches many parts of our systems, so you'll work closely with teams across the company Are passionate about building conversational AI that feels natural, steerable, and safe Care about the societal impacts of voice AI and want to help shape how these systems are developed responsibly Strong candidates may also have experience with: Large language model pretraining and finetuning Training diffusion models for image and audio generation Reinforcement learning for large language models and diffusion models End-to-end system optimization, from performance benchmarking to kernel optimization GPUs, Kubernetes, PyTorch, or distributed training infrastructure Representative projects: Training state-of-the art neural audio codecs for 48 kHz stereo audio Developing novel algorithms for diffusion pretraining and reinforcement learning Scaling audio datasets to millions of hours of high quality audio Creating robust evaluation methodologies for hard-to-measure qualities such as naturalness or expressiveness Studying training dynamics of mixed audio-text language models Optimizing latency and inference throughput for deployed streaming audio systems The annual compensation range for this role is listed below. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.Annual Salary:$350,000 - $500,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work.

How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Cloud Inference team scales and optimizes Claude to serve the massive audiences of developers and enterprise companies across AWS, GCP, Azure, and future cloud service providers (CSPs). We own the end-to-end product of Claude on each cloud platform—from API integration and intelligent request routing to inference execution, capacity management, and day-to-day operations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our engineers are extremely high leverage: we simultaneously drive multiple major revenue streams while optimizing one of Anthropic&#39;s most precious resources—compute. As we expand to more cloud platforms, the complexity of managing inference efficiently across providers with different hardware, networking stacks, and operational models grows significantly. We need engineers who can navigate these platform differences, build robust abstractions that work across providers, and make smart infrastructure decisions that keep us cost-effective at massive scale.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Your work will increase the scale at which our services operate, accelerate our ability to reliably launch new frontier models and innovative features to customers across all platforms, and ensure our LLMs meet rigorous safety, performance, and security standards.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What You&#39;ll Do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Design and build infrastructure that serves Claude across multiple CSPs, accounting for differences in compute hardware, networking, APIs, and operational models&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Collaborate with CSP partner engineering teams to resolve operational issues, influence provider roadmaps, and stand up end-to-end serving on new cloud platforms&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Design and evolve CI/CD automation systems, including validation and deployment pipelines, that reliably ship new model versions to millions of users across cloud platforms without regressions&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Design interfaces and tooling abstractions across CSPs that enable cost-effective inference management, scale across providers, and reduce per-platform complexity&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Contribute to capacity planning and autoscaling strategies that dynamically match supply with demand across CSP validation and production workloads&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Optimize inference cost and performance across providers—designing workload placement and routing systems that direct requests to the most cost-effective accelerator and region&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Contribute to inference features that must work consistently across all platforms&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Analyze observability data across providers to identify performance bottlenecks, cost anomalies, and regressions, and drive remediation based on real-world production workloads&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You May Be a Good Fit If You:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have significant software engineering experience, with a strong background in high-performance, large-scale distributed systems serving millions of users&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have experience building or operating services on at least one major cloud platform (AWS, GCP, or Azure), with exposure to Kubernetes, Infrastructure as Code or container orchestration&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have strong interest in inference&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Thrive in cross-functional collaboration with both internal teams and external partners&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are a fast learner who can quickly ramp up on new technologies, hardware platforms, and provider ecosystems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are highly autonomous and self-driven, taking ownership of problems end-to-end with a bias toward flexibility and high-impact work&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Pick up slack, even when it goes outside your job description&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong Candidates May Also Have Experience With&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Direct experience working with CSP partner teams to scale infrastructure or products across multiple platforms, navigating differences in networking, security, privacy, billing, and managed service offerings&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A background in building platform-agnostic tooling or abstraction layers that work across cloud providers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Hands-on experience with capacity management, cost optimization, or resource planning at scale across heterogeneous environments&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Strong familiarity with LLM inference optimization, batching, caching, and serving strategies&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience with Machine learning infrastructure including GPUs, TPUs, Trainium, or other AI accelerators&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Background designing and building CI/CD systems that automate deployment and validation

degree in a related field or equivalent experience.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Location-based hybrid policy:&lt;/strong&gt; Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

degree in a related field or equivalent experience.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Location-based hybrid policy:&lt;/strong&gt; Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

You&#39;ll develop everything from keynote narratives and session abstracts to speaker preparation materials and post-event content, ensuring consistency and quality across Anthropic-owned events like

At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts.

We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco.

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marketing Events Lead, Enterprise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As the Enterprise Events Lead at Anthropic, you will own the development and execution of enterprise-focused events that accelerate pipeline, deepen customer relationships, and elevate Anthropic&#39;s brand presence with key enterprise audiences. You will be responsible for designing and delivering high-impact event experiences—from major industry conferences to hosted summits, and partner activations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In this role, you&#39;ll collaborate closely with Sales, Partnerships, Product Marketing, and Creative teams to ensure every event touchpoint reinforces Anthropic&#39;s position as a leader in safe, frontier AI. You&#39;ll bring a strategic mindset grounded in data, a talent for flawless execution under pressure, and the ability to translate complex enterprise goals into compelling in-person and hybrid experiences.

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Safeguards Engineering builds and operates the infrastructure that keeps Anthropic&#39;s AI systems safe in production — the classifiers, detection pipelines, evaluation platforms, and monitoring systems that sit between our models and the real world. That infrastructure needs to be not just correct, but &lt;em&gt;reliable&lt;/em&gt;: when a safety-critical pipeline goes down or degrades, the consequences can be serious, and they can be invisible until someone looks closely.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a Technical Program Manager for Safeguards Infrastructure and Evals, you&#39;ll own the operational health and forward momentum of this stack. Your primary responsibility is driving reliability — owning the incident-response and post-mortem process, ensuring SLOs are defined and met in partnership with various teams, and making sure that when things go wrong, the right people know, the right actions get taken, and those actions actually get closed out. Alongside that ongoing operational rhythm, you&#39;ll coordinate the larger platform investments: migrations, eval-platform improvements, and the cross-team dependencies that connect them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This role sits at the intersection of operations and program management. It requires genuine technical depth — you need to understand how these systems work well enough to triage effectively, judge what&#39;s actually safety-critical versus what can wait, and have informed conversations with the engineers building and maintaining them. But the core of the job is keeping the machine running well and the work moving.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What You&#39;ll Do:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Own the Safeguards Engineering ops review - &lt;/strong&gt;Drive the recurring cadence that keeps the team informed and coordinated: surfacing recent incidents and failures, bringing visibility to reliability trends, and making sure the right people are in the room when decisions need to be made. This is the heartbeat of how Safeguards Eng stays ahead of operational risk.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drive incident tracking and post-mortem execution - &lt;/strong&gt;When incidents happen — and in this space, they happen regularly — you&#39;ll make sure they get followed through properly. That means tracking incidents across the organization (including those owned by partner teams like Inference), ensuring post-mortems get written, and most critically, making sure the action items that come out of them actually get done. Closing the loop on post-mortem actions is one of the highest-leverage things this role does.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish and maintain SLOs with partner teams - &lt;/strong&gt;Work with Safeguards Engineering teams and key partners — particularly Inference and Cloud Inference — to define service-level objectives for safety-critical pipelines. Then build the tracking and reporting that makes it possible to tell whether those SLOs are being met, and surface it when they&#39;re not.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintain runbook quality and incident-ownership clarity - &lt;/strong&gt;Safety-critical systems need clear playbooks for when things go wrong. Partner with engineering leads to keep runbooks accurate, actionable, and up to date — and ensure that ownership of incidents (including for areas like account-banning false positives and CSAM detection) is unambiguous so that nothing falls through the cracks during an active incident.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drive platform migrations and infrastructure projects - &lt;/strong&gt;Own the program management for the larger infrastructure work on the roadmap: migrating the infra from one platform to the next, moving from one incident platform to the next and from one cloud system monitoring to another, and other migrations as they come. These are cross-team efforts with real dependencies — your job is to keep them sequenced, on track, and connected to the teams that need them.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coordinate evals platform improvements - &lt;/strong&gt;Partner with the evals engineering team to drive improvements to the evaluation platform — including self-serve capabilities and the broader eval factory infrastructure. Help scope the work, track dependencies on other Safeguards systems, and make sure the evals platform is keeping pace with the team&#39;s needs.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You might be a good fit if you:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have solid technical program management experience, particularly in operational or infrastructure-heavy environments — you&#39;re comfortable owning a mix of ongoing operational cadences and discrete project work simultaneously.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Understand how production ML systems work well enough to triage incidents intelligently and have substantive conversations with engineers about what&#39;s going wrong and why — you don&#39;t need to write the code, but you need to follow the technical thread.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are energized by closing loops. Post-mortem action items that never get done, SLOs that no one checks, runbooks that go stale — these things bother you, and you know how to build the processes and follow-ups that fix them.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Can work effectively across team boundaries — comfortable coordinating with partner teams (like Inference) where you don&#39;t have direct authority, and skilled at keeping shared work moving through influence and clear communication.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Thrive in environments where the work shifts between &quot;keep the lights on&quot; and &quot;build something new&quot; — and can context-switch between incident follow-ups and longer-horizon platform projects without dropping either.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have experience with or strong interest in AI safety — you understand why the reliability of a safety-critical pipeline is a different kind of problem than the reliability of a product feature, and that distinction motivates you.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong candidates may also:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have experience with SRE practices, incident management frameworks, or on-call operations at scale.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have worked on or with evaluation infrastructure for ML systems — understanding how evals get designed, run, and interpreted.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have experience driving infrastructure migrations in complex, multi-team environments — particularly where the migration touches operational systems that can&#39;t go offline.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Be familiar with monitoring and alerting tooling (PagerDuty, Datadog, or equivalents) and the operational culture around them.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deadline to apply:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;None, applications will be received on a rolling basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The annual compensation range for this role is listed below.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (&quot;OTE&quot;) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Annual Salary:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-range&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$290,000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;divider&quot;&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;$365,000 USD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logistics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education requirements: &lt;/strong&gt;We require at least a Bachelor&#39;s degree in a related field or equivalent experience.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Location-based hybrid policy:&lt;/strong&gt; Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day.

At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco.

Post-mortem action items that never get done, SLOs that no one checks, runbooks that go stale — these things bother you, and you know how to build the processes and follow-ups that fix them.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Can work effectively across team boundaries — comfortable coordinating with partner teams (like Inference) where you don&#39;t have direct authority, and skilled at keeping shared work moving through influence and clear communication.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Thrive in environments where the work shifts between &quot;keep the lights on&quot; and &quot;build something new&quot; — and can context-switch between incident follow-ups and longer-horizon platform projects without dropping either.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have experience with or strong interest in AI safety — you understand why the reliability of a safety-critical pipeline is a different kind of problem than the reliability of a product feature, and that distinction motivates you.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong candidates may also:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have experience with SRE practices, incident management frameworks, or on-call operations at scale.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have worked on or with evaluation infrastructure for ML systems — understanding how evals get designed, run, and interpreted.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have experience driving infrastructure migrations in complex, multi-team environments — particularly where the migration touches operational systems that can&#39;t go offline.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Be familiar with monitoring and alerting tooling (PagerDuty, Datadog, or equivalents) and the operational culture around them.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deadline to apply:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;None, applications will be received on a rolling basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The annual compensation range for this role is listed below.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (&quot;OTE&quot;) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Annual Salary:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-range&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$290,000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;divider&quot;&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;$365,000 USD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logistics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education requirements: &lt;/strong&gt;We require at least a Bachelor&#39;s degree in a related field or equivalent experience.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Location-based hybrid policy:&lt;/strong&gt; Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 18pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Role:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The U.S. healthcare system wastes hundreds of billions of dollars a year on administrative complexity—the friction between payers, providers, and the systems that connect them. We believe AI can materially reduce that waste, and we’re building the products to do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We’re looking for someone to own this effort. As the product lead for Healthcare, you will be Anthropic’s healthcare leader—setting strategy, shipping products, and serving as the company’s voice in one of the most consequential industries AI will transform. You’ll work across product, engineering, research, go-to-market, policy, and safety to build a healthcare business from early momentum into a scaled vertical.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a 0→1 role. It will be your job to take ownership, sharpen the plan, and drive execution. The scope is broad—healthcare touches nearly every function at the company—and you need to be the kind of person who thrives catching all the balls, triaging what matters, and making sure nothing important falls through the cracks. Low ego, high accountability.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 18pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Own Anthropic’s healthcare strategy end-to-end. You are the DRI, accountable for the plan, the priorities, and the results.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build and ship AI products that address high-value workflows across the payer, provider, and health tech ecosystem. Identify where the biggest pain is, define what to build, and drive it to market.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Be Anthropic’s healthcare leader externally. When a customer, partner, regulator, government agency, or journalist wants to talk to Anthropic about healthcare, you take the meeting. You’re credible, prepared, and trusted.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Triage and coordinate the many cross-functional threads that healthcare creates across the company—product, research, engineering, applied AI, sales, safety, policy, legal, and compliance. Find a home for everything and make sure it moves forward.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Define the product and research roadmap in close partnership with engineering and research teams. You don’t need to lead research day-to-day, but you need sharp instincts about where the model falls short in healthcare contexts and the ability to work with the right teams to close those gaps.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Drive regulatory readiness—including HIPAA compliance—across Anthropic’s products as they serve healthcare customers.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build relationships with strategic customers and partners. Translate what you learn from the market into product priorities, data partnerships, and go-to-market strategy.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 18pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You May Be a Good Fit If:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You’ve spent meaningful time inside the healthcare industry. You’ve worked deeply with payers, providers, or health tech companies and you know how the system actually works: the regulations, the incentives, the operational realities, and where the real inefficiencies live.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You have 10+ years of experience in healthcare, with a significant portion spent close to administrative workflows, revenue cycle, payer operations, or the technology that supports them.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You’ve built products or businesses from scratch (0→1) in complex, regulated environments. You know what it takes to go from ambiguity to a shipped product with real customers.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You have strong cross-functional instincts and genuine willingness to do the work. This role involves as much coordination, follow-through, and unglamorous problem-solving as it does strategy. You are not above any task.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You have strong product judgment and enough technical fluency to engage meaningfully with engineers and researchers on tradeoffs—without needing to be the most technical person in the room. You know when the model isn’t good enough for a given use case and can articulate what “better” looks like.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You communicate exceptionally well. You can translate between the languages of AI capabilities, healthcare operations, regulatory requirements, and business outcomes with equal comfort.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You have experience navigating HIPAA, CMS regulations, or other healthcare compliance frameworks and understand what it takes to ship products in heavily regulated industries.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 18pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Healthcare is one of the largest and most important industries in the world, and it’s on the cusp of a generational technology shift. Anthropic is building the most capable and safety-focused AI in the industry, and this role puts you at the center of bringing that technology to the sector where it can do the most good. You’ll have the autonomy to define strategy, the mandate to ship products, and the backing of a world-class team across research, engineering, and go-to-market.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you’re the kind of person who wants to build something that matters—and has the healthcare expertise and entrepreneurial drive to actually pull it off—we want to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The annual compensation range for this role is listed below.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (&quot;OTE&quot;) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Annual Salary:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-range&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$485,000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;divider&quot;&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;$645,000 USD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logistics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education requirements: &lt;/strong&gt;We require at least a Bachelor&#39;s degree in a related field or equivalent experience.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Location-based hybrid policy:&lt;/strong&gt; Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time.

However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses.

      "description": "&lt;div class=&quot;content-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Anthropic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 18pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Role:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The U.S. healthcare system wastes hundreds of billions of dollars a year on administrative complexity—the friction between payers, providers, and the systems that connect them. We believe AI can materially reduce that waste, and we’re building the products to do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We’re looking for someone to own this effort. As the product lead for Healthcare, you will be Anthropic’s healthcare leader—setting strategy, shipping products, and serving as the company’s voice in one of the most consequential industries AI will transform. You’ll work across product, engineering, research, go-to-market, policy, and safety to build a healthcare business from early momentum into a scaled vertical.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a 0→1 role. It will be your job to take ownership, sharpen the plan, and drive execution. The scope is broad—healthcare touches nearly every function at the company—and you need to be the kind of person who thrives catching all the balls, triaging what matters, and making sure nothing important falls through the cracks. Low ego, high accountability.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 18pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Own Anthropic’s healthcare strategy end-to-end. You are the DRI, accountable for the plan, the priorities, and the results.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build and ship AI products that address high-value workflows across the payer, provider, and health tech ecosystem. Identify where the biggest pain is, define what to build, and drive it to market.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Be Anthropic’s healthcare leader externally. When a customer, partner, regulator, government agency, or journalist wants to talk to Anthropic about healthcare, you take the meeting. You’re credible, prepared, and trusted.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Triage and coordinate the many cross-functional threads that healthcare creates across the company—product, research, engineering, applied AI, sales, safety, policy, legal, and compliance. Find a home for everything and make sure it moves forward.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Define the product and research roadmap in close partnership with engineering and research teams. You don’t need to lead research day-to-day, but you need sharp instincts about where the model falls short in healthcare contexts and the ability to work with the right teams to close those gaps.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Drive regulatory readiness—including HIPAA compliance—across Anthropic’s products as they serve healthcare customers.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build relationships with strategic customers and partners.

However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day.

At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco.

However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

Discord plays a uniquely important role in the future of gaming. We are focused on making it easier and more fun for people to talk and hang out before, during, and after playing games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our Web Platform team is responsible for building and maintaining the critical systems that power Discord&#39;s frontend development across web, desktop, and mobile platforms.

This role focuses on enabling users to &lt;em&gt;find, explore, and act&lt;/em&gt; on observability and security data using AI-powered semantic understanding rather than rigid query syntax or navigation paths.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As Datadog continues to expand in breadth and depth, discovering the right data, services, insights, or actions becomes increasingly complex.

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are seeking a GRC Automation Lead to join our GRC organization and build the technical foundation for how we scale our risk and compliance programs. In this role, you will lead the team that designs and implements automated workflows, data pipelines, and integrations that transform manual compliance processes into scalable engineering systems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a greenfield opportunity to establish the team, architecture, and integrations that will define how we approach governance, risk, and compliance at Anthropic. The core challenge is a data problem: compliance information lives across dozens of systems—cloud infrastructure, identity providers, HR platforms, ticketing tools, code repositories—and your job is to design systems that bring it together, normalize it, and make it actionable. Success in this role comes from understanding how systems connect and how data flows between them, not from writing code yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At Anthropic, you&#39;ll also have a unique advantage: the ability to design AI-powered workflows where Claude acts as an extension of your team, handling tasks that would traditionally require additional headcount or manual effort. You&#39;ll need ingenuity to identify where agentic AI can accelerate evidence collection, interpret unstructured data, triage compliance gaps, and augment human judgment in risk assessments. Working closely with Security, IT, and Engineering teams, you&#39;ll translate compliance and regulatory requirements into solutions that support audit programs including SOC 2, ISO, HIPAA, and FedRAMP, building systems that combine traditional automation with AI capabilities to achieve scale that wouldn&#39;t otherwise be possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Responsibilities:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Lead the team that establishes foundational GRC processes and architecture. Design and build automated workflows for risk management and compliance, creating scalable systems that enable continuous monitoring as Anthropic grows.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build data pipelines that aggregate risk, control, and asset information from across our technology stack. This means solving hard data integration problems: mapping disparate schemas, handling inconsistent data quality, and creating unified views of compliance posture through dashboards and reporting tools.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Inform GRC platform strategy and implementation: in partnership with other programs, evaluate, select, and deploy tooling that meets our compliance requirements.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Translate written policies and compliance requirements into policy-as-code—working with Engineering and Security teams to express requirements as enforceable rules, automated checks, and continuous validation rather than static documents.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Establish feedback loops between policy and implementation: surface where technical controls diverge from written requirements, identify where policies need to evolve based on infrastructure realities, and ensure that compliance requirements are expressed in terms engineers can act on.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Design and deploy agentic AI workflows that extend team capacity, using Claude to automate evidence analysis, monitor control effectiveness, draft audit responses, interpret policy documents, and handle other tasks that require reasoning over unstructured information.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Design and maintain integrations connecting GRC tooling with cloud infrastructure, identity management systems, HRIS platforms, ticketing systems, version control, and CI/CD pipelines—working with engineers to implement integrations that enable automated evidence collection and continuous compliance validation.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build and lead the GRC Automation function as we scale: hiring team members, establishing practices, and defining the technical roadmap for governance and compliance automation at Anthropic.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;You may be a good fit if you:&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have 3-4+ years of experience managing technical individual contributors or systems-focused teams, with a proven track record of building or scaling small teams (2-5 people) in security, compliance, automation, or operations functions.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are a systems thinker first. You understand how complex environments work: how data flows between systems, where integration points exist, what breaks when systems don&#39;t talk to each other. Your strength is designing the right architecture and environment for security monitoring, not necessarily implementing it yourself.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have 5+ years of experience designing automated workflows, data pipelines, or system integrations, whether through traditional development, low-code platforms, GRC tools, or process automation. We care about your ability to solve integration problems, not your programming language proficiency.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have a relentless focus on data integration: you understand how to pull data from multiple sources, normalize it, join it meaningfully, and surface insights. You&#39;re comfortable reasoning about messy, inconsistent data and designing systems that handle edge cases gracefully.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Understand APIs and integration patterns conceptually: REST APIs, webhooks, authentication flows, polling vs. push architectures, and can evaluate systems based on how well they expose data and support automation, even if you&#39;re not writing the integration code yourself.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Can work independently with minimal guidance, taking ownership of complex problems from design through implementation while managing ambiguity inherent in early-stage programs.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have strong analytical and problem-solving skills with attention to detail necessary for compliance work, balanced with pragmatism about risk-based prioritization in fast-paced environments.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Strong candidates may have:&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience designing or implementing AI-powered automation, agentic workflows, or LLM-based tooling in operational contexts.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience with GRC platforms such as ServiceNow GRC, Vanta, Drata, OneTrust, RSA Archer, or similar tools including configuration, customization, and integration capabilities&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with scripting languages (Python or similar) for automation tasks, API interactions, and data transformation.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Prior experience in high-growth startup environments demonstrating ability to build scalable processes and adapt quickly to changing requirements and priorities&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with Infrastructure as Code tools (Terraform, CloudFormation, Ansible) and DevSecOps practices including CI/CD pipeline integration and policy-as-code implementations.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure) and an understanding of how compliance-relevant data can be extracted from their APIs and logging systems.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deadline to apply:&lt;/strong&gt; None, applications will be received on a rolling basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The annual compensation range for this role is listed below.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (&quot;OTE&quot;) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Annual Salary:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-range&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$345,000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;divider&quot;&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;$345,000 USD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logistics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education requirements: &lt;/strong&gt;We require at least a Bachelor&#39;s degree in a related field or equivalent experience.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Location-based hybrid policy:&lt;/strong&gt; Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time.

As a Product Manager for the Safeguards team at Anthropic, you will own the ideation, design, development and deployment of Safeguards systems and relevant product UX to ensure we are advancing frontier models safely to users across various cloud platforms. You will work closely with our research and product teams to develop detections, evals, interventions, and tools to measure and mitigate deployment and user risks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are looking for a product manager who is deeply committed to making AI safe and beneficial for humanity.&amp;nbsp; You are aware of the risks and are committed to working with experts and coming up with ideas for Anthropic to implement. You have deep technical expertise in development, deployment and measurement of Safeguards systems. You thrive in rapidly moving and ambiguous environments.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Responsibilities:&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Determine how to build in safety by design upstream and leverage downstream defenses for Anthropic’s frontier models, AI products, customers on different surfaces - Claude.ai, 1P API, external Cloud providers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ability to write safety evals and communicate externally about safety.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Drive impact via ruthless prioritization by clearly defining problems, solution options forward, clarity on both business &amp;amp; technical tradeoffs and accordingly clear requirements toward MVP vs. ideal state.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Align &amp;amp; collaborate with policy, enforcement, research, engineering and cross functional stakeholders.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Understand the AI landscape and ecosystem to plan for mitigation of deployment risks of increasingly powerful models and determined adversaries.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Lead the development of metrics to understand the area, performance, blindspots to help inform future project planning.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;You may be a good fit if you have:&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;5+ years in product management with a focus on fast problem understanding, building roadmaps with tractable progress, ability to get into the details on data, detection &amp;amp; interventions, infrastructure &amp;amp; tools, and/or evals.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ability to make technical tradeoff decisions; ideally with experience working across policy experts, AI/ML research engineers and software engineering teams to design and build state of the art safety systems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Strong user understanding of how our products are used, their Safeguards concerns and how we provide the best solutions.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Demonstrated ability to build product and engineering strategy across multiple cross-functional teams for a rapidly changing space.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Demonstrated experience in designing and building metrics to evaluate risks, system performance, user impact and making crisp tradeoffs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Very strong ability to navigate, and prioritize amidst rapidly changing product specs, and to flex into different domains to bring clarity and execute.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Evidence of exercising judgment and decision making in ambiguous situations.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Planning, building, launching and measuring new products / systems in a zero to one environment.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ability to clearly articulate complex technical concepts to non-technical audiences in written and verbal communication.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Think creatively about the risks and benefits of new technologies, and think beyond past checklists and playbooks.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The annual compensation range for this role is listed below.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (&quot;OTE&quot;) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Annual Salary:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-range&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$305,000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;divider&quot;&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;$385,000 USD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logistics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education requirements: &lt;/strong&gt;We require at least a Bachelor&#39;s degree in a related field or equivalent experience.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Location-based hybrid policy:&lt;/strong&gt; Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;About the role&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a Segment Marketing Manager for Financial Services &amp;amp; Insurance at Anthropic, you will own the end-to-end demand marketing strategy for one of the most consequential verticals in our go-to-market motion. Financial services and insurance organizations are among the earliest adopters of enterprise AI, and this role sits at the intersection of deep industry expertise and Anthropic&#39;s mission to build safe, reliable AI systems that deliver real business value.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You&#39;ll be responsible for developing and executing industry campaigns, ABM, and targeted marketing programs that drive awareness, pipeline, and adoption of Claude and Anthropic&#39;s API among financial institutions, insurers, and related firms. This means deeply understanding the unique challenges, regulatory landscape, and decision-making dynamics of this segment — and translating that understanding into campaigns, content, and experiences that resonate with technical and business stakeholders alike.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is an ideal opportunity for someone who thrives at the intersection of strategic thinking and hands-on execution, and who is energized by the challenge of bringing frontier AI technology to an industry where trust, compliance, and reliability are non-negotiable.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2

positioning, messaging, campaign planning, and go-to-market coordination in close partnership with Sales&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Create and execute integrated marketing programs — spanning digital, content, events, and partner channels — designed to generate pipeline and accelerate the sales cycle for enterprise prospects in this vertical&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Build a deep understanding of the competitive landscape, buyer personas, and AI adoption patterns specific to financial services and insurance, and translate those insights into actionable marketing strategies&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Develop segment-specific content including case studies, solution guides, thought leadership pieces, and enablement materials that speak to the priorities and pain points of this industry&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Collaborate cross-functionally with product, sales, communications, design, and research teams to ensure marketing efforts are aligned with product capabilities and business objectives&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Design and

Anthropic&#39;s reach and credibility within the segment&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Define and track key performance metrics for segment marketing programs, using data to

you:&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Have 7+ years of experience in B2B marketing, with a focus on enterprise technology or SaaS, and demonstrated expertise in one or more verticals

pipeline and revenue in complex, enterprise sales cycles&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Understand the decision-making dynamics, regulatory considerations, and technology evaluation processes that are common in financial services organizations&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Are skilled at translating complex technical capabilities into compelling, audience-specific narratives — particularly for both technical and business stakeholders&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Have experience collaborating closely with enterprise sales teams to align marketing

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re looking for an SEO Lead to join Anthropic&#39;s growing marketing team. You&#39;ll own organic search strategy and technical SEO infrastructure across Anthropic&#39;s web properties — including &lt;a class=&quot;text-accent-secondary-100 underline&quot; href=&quot;http://claude.ai&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;claude.ai&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;text-accent-secondary-100 underline&quot; href=&quot;http://docs.anthropic.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;docs.anthropic.com&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a class=&quot;text-accent-secondary-100 underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;anthropic.com&lt;/a&gt; — ensuring our products and developer resources are discoverable, performant, and well-positioned in an evolving search landscape.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a high-impact, hands-on individual contributor role at the intersection of marketing, engineering, and data. You&#39;ll independently define and execute the technical SEO roadmap, drive site experimentation and conversion optimization, and make strategic recommendations that shape how we invest in organic growth. You&#39;ll partner closely with engineering, content, and analytics teams to scale organic discovery — operating with a high degree of autonomy while keeping cross-functional stakeholders aligned.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As AI reshapes how people search for and discover information, you&#39;ll also help define our strategy for emerging search experiences like AI Overviews and answer engines. This role is ideal for someone who thrives in fast-moving, technically complex environments — and who is energized by the opportunity to build foundational SEO infrastructure at a company whose products are at the forefront of AI.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical SEO Strategy

issues&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Develop and maintain the SEO playbook for international expansion, including hreflang implementation and localized content optimization&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Documentation &amp;amp; Content Optimization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Build and own the

education teams, and more&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Audit and optimize documentation search rankings and information architecture for developer-focused

Screaming Frog, Ahrefs, SEMrush, and Google Search Console&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Design, execute, and analyze A/B and multivariate experiments across key conversion flows (signup, onboarding, upgrade) using experimentation platforms like Statsig&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Define experiment hypotheses, ensure statistical rigor in test design and

However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is seeking talented and experienced Staff+ Software Engineers to join our Continuous Integration (CI) team within the Developer Productivity organization. The CI team is responsible for the infrastructure that enables hundreds of engineers to ship code safely and efficiently to production. By joining this team, you&#39;ll have a direct impact on the velocity and reliability of Anthropic&#39;s research and product development.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The CI team manages Anthropic&#39;s continuous integration system, which includes:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CI infrastructure&lt;/strong&gt; for automated testing and code quality assurance across our monorepo, designed to scale with rapid growth&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Test infrastructure&lt;/strong&gt; that runs on Kubernetes clusters across multiple cloud providers, handling intelligent test selection, execution, and reporting a large and complex test suite&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Merge queue management&lt;/strong&gt; and complex branching strategies that ensure code quality at scale&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CI tooling and automation&lt;/strong&gt; to improve developer productivity and reduce operational overhead&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Design and build highly reliable, scalable CI infrastructure that supports thousands of daily builds across multiple cloud providers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Develop intelligent test selection systems that reduce CI time while maintaining code quality&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build and improve incident response automation, including cluster load shedding, automatic recovery, and observability tooling&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Improve test infrastructure reliability through flake detection, quarantine systems, and test state management&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You May Be a Good Fit If You:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have 10+ years of relevant industry experience building and operating large-scale CI/CD systems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have deep experience with CI orchestration tools (Buildkite, Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or similar)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are obsessed with developer productivity and reducing friction in the software development lifecycle&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have experience with container orchestration at scale&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have excellent communication skills and enjoy supporting internal partners&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Care deeply about reliability and building systems that &quot;never fail the same way twice&quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong Candidates May Also Have:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience with merge queues and branch management at scale&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience with test infrastructure, including intelligent test selection and flake management&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience building CLI tools and developer-facing services&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;GitHub API and automation experience&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deadline to apply:&lt;/strong&gt; None. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The annual compensation range for this role is listed below.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (&quot;OTE&quot;) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Annual Salary:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-range&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$405,000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;divider&quot;&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;$485,000 USD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logistics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education requirements: &lt;/strong&gt;We require at least a Bachelor&#39;s degree in a related field or equivalent experience.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Location-based hybrid policy:&lt;/strong&gt; Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

Discord plays a uniquely important role in the future of gaming. We are focused on making it easier and more fun for people to talk and hang out before, during, and after playing games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;People come to Discord before, during, and after gaming, and we want to make that experience even better.

We believe that gaming is better when playing with friends, and aim to provide the features and tooling for developers to help us enrich those experiences. This is also reflected in how we work!

However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are looking for a Head of IT SOX to join our Internal Audit SOX team at Anthropic. In this role, you will lead the organization&#39;s IT SOX compliance program, with a primary focus on IT General Controls (ITGCs), application controls, and system/process risk assessments. You&#39;ll work cross-functionally with Engineering, Security, IT, DevOps, and Finance to ensure the organization meets SOX 404 compliance requirements in a rapidly scaling, technology-driven environment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a unique opportunity to build IT SOX controls at an AI-first company, leveraging cutting-edge AI technology to create innovative, automated, and scalable compliance solutions. You will help define how AI can transform traditional SOX processes—from continuous monitoring to intelligent risk assessment—while maintaining the rigor required for public company compliance.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As the Head of IT SOX, you will own SOX IT planning, scoping, testing, remediation, and reporting activities. You&#39;ll work directly with technical partners to design and implement scalable controls, oversee documentation, and manage communication with external auditors. This role reports to the Head of Internal Audit and plays a critical part in strengthening internal control maturity as the company scales through pre-IPO readiness and longer term as a public company.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOX IT Program Leadership&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Lead and manage the organization&#39;s end-to-end IT SOX compliance program&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Own SOX IT planning, scoping, testing, remediation, and reporting activities&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Build scalable, automated, and sustainable controls to support growth through pre-IPO and post-IPO readiness&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Develop and maintain the SOX IT compliance roadmap aligned with organizational growth&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Pioneer the use of AI and automation technologies to enhance control effectiveness, continuous monitoring, and risk detection&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Drive IT controls rationalization initiatives to optimize the control environment and increase reliance on IT automated controls (ITACs)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ITGC and Application Controls&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Design, implement, and monitor IT General Controls (ITGCs) across critical systems&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Evaluate and test application controls and IT automated controls (ITACs) to ensure proper functionality and compliance&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Conduct system and process risk assessments to identify control gaps and remediation needs&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Oversee control documentation and ensure audit-ready evidence is maintained&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Assess and monitor Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) controls for new system implementations and changes&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cross-Functional Partnership&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Partner with Engineering, Security, IT, DevOps, and Finance teams to implement scalable controls&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Work directly with technical partners to design controls that align with business operations&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Collaborate with process owners to identify control improvements and automation opportunities&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Support SEC cybersecurity disclosure requirements and ongoing monitoring of cyber risks&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;External Audit Management&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Serve as the primary point of contact for

walkthroughs&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Track and report on IT SOX compliance status to leadership, the Board, and Audit

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;text-accent-secondary-100 underline&quot; href=&quot;http://Claude.ai&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Claude.ai&lt;/a&gt; is Anthropic&#39;s flagship consumer product, spanning web, mobile, desktop, and browser extensions—and it&#39;s growing fast. We&#39;re looking for an engineering leader to own the foundational platform that powers all of these surfaces: the shared infrastructure, APIs, tooling, and systems that enable product teams to ship reliably, quickly, and with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In this role, you&#39;ll lead the team responsible for reliability, latency, developer velocity, and common components across &lt;a class=&quot;text-accent-secondary-100 underline&quot; href=&quot;http://Claude.ai&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Claude.ai&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s UI surfaces. This includes the backend-for-frontend (BFF) APIs that power our client applications. Your work will directly determine how fast customer, partner, and product teams can innovate—and how stable their experiences are when they ship. This is a highly technical leadership role: you&#39;ll stay close to the code, drive architectural decisions, and build the systems that let others move faster.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a unique opportunity to shape the developer experience and platform foundations for one of the most rapidly evolving AI products in the world.

We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day.

At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

Operations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Drive programs to establish and achieve reliability targets across training infrastructure and production services&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Coordinate incident response improvements, post-mortem processes, and on-call rotations that help teams operate effectively&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Establish metrics and dashboards to track infrastructure health, capacity utilization, and operational excellence&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cross-functional Coordination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Serve as the critical bridge between infrastructure teams, research, and product, translating technical complexities into clear updates for a variety of audiences&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Consult with stakeholders to deeply understand infrastructure, data, and compute needs, identifying solutions to support frontier research and product development&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Drive alignment on priorities and timelines across teams with competing constraints&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You May Be a Good Fit If You&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have 5+ years of technical program management experience, with a track record of successfully delivering complex infrastructure programs in ML/AI systems or large-scale distributed systems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have deep technical understanding of infrastructure systems—enough to engage substantively with engineers, identify technical risks, and add value beyond project tracking&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Excel at creating structure and processes in ambiguous environments, bringing clarity to complex cross-team initiatives&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have strong stakeholder management skills and can build trust with both technical and non-technical partners&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are comfortable navigating competing priorities and using data to drive technical decisions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have experience with developer productivity initiatives, CI/CD systems, or infrastructure scaling&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Thrive in fast-paced environments and can balance strategic planning with tactical execution&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are obsessed with reliability, scalability, security, and continuous improvement&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have a passion for supporting internal partners like research to understand their unique needs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are passionate about AI infrastructure and understand the unique challenges of building and operating systems at frontier scale&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience with Kubernetes, cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure), and ML infrastructure (GPU/TPU/Trainium clusters)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Background working with research teams and translating their needs into concrete technical requirements&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience driving adoption of AI tools to improve engineering productivity&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with observability tooling and practices&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deadline to Apply: &lt;/strong&gt;None, applications will be received on a rolling basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The annual compensation range for this role is listed below.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (&quot;OTE&quot;) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Annual Salary:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-range&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$290,000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;divider&quot;&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;$365,000 USD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logistics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education requirements: &lt;/strong&gt;We require at least a Bachelor&#39;s degree in a related field or equivalent experience.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Location-based hybrid policy:&lt;/strong&gt; Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day.

At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

We help companies spend with confidence with integrated corporate cards, banking, and global payments, plus intuitive software for travel and expenses. Tens of thousands of companies from startups to enterprises — including DoorDash, Flexport, and Compass — use Brex to proactively control spend, reduce costs, and increase efficiency on a global scale.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Working at Brex allows you to push your limits, challenge the status quo, and collaborate with some of the brightest minds in the industry.

You&#39;ll build the infrastructure that makes AI-native education real — not as a concept, but as a working system that people interact with every day.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You’ll own the technical vision for our AI-driven educational experience: the platform layer, enterprise readiness features, the data architecture, the AI-augmented pipelines, the integrations, and the delivery systems. You&#39;ll work with a handful of highly technical educational collaborators to own the technical vision and execution for how Anthropic’s education team delivers educational experiences at scale, and you&#39;ll build the AI-augmented pipelines and platform capabilities that let a small team of educators operate with reach and responsiveness that would otherwise require an organization ten times larger.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is an engineering role for someone who genuinely cares about how people learn. You&#39;ll make platform decisions that are deeply educational, and you need the judgment to make those decisions well, not just implement someone else&#39;s spec.

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;About the Role:&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is seeking an Education Platform Engineering Lead to help build the technical foundation for how Anthropic educates customers and enterprises at scale, and to shape what that even means when AI is the delivery mechanism, not just the subject being taught.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Your work will define how millions of people experience learning about Claude: how content is served and adapted in real time, how assessments respond to what a learner actually understands, how credentialing systems verify genuine competence rather than course completion, and how the entire platform evolves as fast as the product it teaches. You&#39;ll build the infrastructure that makes AI-native education real — not as a concept, but as a working system that people interact with every day.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You’ll own the technical vision for our AI-driven educational experience: the platform layer, enterprise readiness features, the data architecture, the AI-augmented pipelines, the integrations, and the delivery systems. You&#39;ll work with a handful of highly technical educational collaborators to own the technical vision and execution for how Anthropic’s education team delivers educational experiences at scale, and you&#39;ll build the AI-augmented pipelines and platform capabilities that let a small team of educators operate with reach and responsiveness that would otherwise require an organization ten times larger.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is an engineering role for someone who genuinely cares about how people learn. You&#39;ll make platform decisions that are deeply educational, and you need the judgment to make those decisions well, not just implement someone else&#39;s spec. You&#39;ll interface closely with Anthropic&#39;s security, infrastructure, and data teams, and you&#39;ll partner with trainers and educators on the GTM, devrel, and education teams who will be your primary stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Anthropic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is an AI safety and research company that&#39;s working to build reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems.
