      "job_description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the role: Anthropic’s performance and scaling teams focus on making the most efficient and impactful use of our compute resources, be it inference or training. As an Engineering Manager on these teams you will be responsible for ensuring you and your team are identifying and removing bottlenecks, building robust and durable solutions, and maximizing the efficiency of our systems. You also will help bring clarity, focus, and context to your teams in a fast paced, dynamic environment. Responsibilities: Provide front-line leadership of engineering efforts to improve model performance and scale our inference and training systems Become familiar with the team’s technical stack enough to make targeted contributions as an individual contributor Manage day-to-day execution of the team's work Prioritize the team’s work and manage projects in a highly dynamic, fast paced environment Coach and support your reports in understanding, and pursuing, their professional growth Maintain a deep understanding of the team's technical work and its implications for AI safety You may be a good fit if you: Have 1+ years of management experience in a technical environment, particularly performance or distributed systems Have a background in machine learning, AI, or a similar related technical field Are deeply interested in the potential transformative effects of advanced AI systems and are committed to ensuring their safe development Excel at building strong relationships with stakeholders at all levels Are a quick learner, capable of understanding and contributing to discussions on complex technical topics Have experience managing teams through periods of rapid growth and change Are a quick study: this team sits at the intersection of a large number of different complex technical systems that you’ll need to understand (at a high level of abstraction) to be effective Strong candidates may also have experience with: High performance, large-scale ML systems GPU/Accelerator programming ML framework internals OS internals Language modeling with transformers The expected base compensation for this position is below. Our total compensation package for full-time employees includes equity, benefits, and may include incentive compensation.Annual Salary:$425,000 - $560,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

      "job_description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems. About the role: You want to build the cutting-edge systems that train AI models like Claude. You're excited to work at the frontier of machine learning, implementing and improving advanced techniques to create ever more capable, reliable and steerable AI. As an ML Systems Engineer on our Reinforcement Learning Engineering team, you'll be responsible for the critical algorithms and infrastructure that our researchers depend on to train models. Your work will directly enable breakthroughs in AI capabilities and safety. You'll focus obsessively on improving the performance, robustness, and usability of these systems so our research can progress as quickly as possible. You're energized by the challenge of supporting and empowering our research team in the mission to build beneficial AI systems. Our finetuning researchers train our production Claude models, and internal research models, using RLHF and other related methods. Your job will be to build, maintain, and improve the algorithms and systems that these researchers use to train models. You’ll be responsible for improving the speed, reliability, and ease-of-use of these systems. You may be a good fit if you: Have 4+ years of software engineering experience Like working on systems and tools that make other people more productive Are results-oriented, with a bias towards flexibility and impact Pick up slack, even if it goes outside your job description Enjoy pair programming (we love to pair!) Want to learn more about machine learning research Care about the societal impacts of your work Strong candidates may also have experience with: High performance, large scale distributed systems Large scale LLM training Python Implementing LLM finetuning algorithms, such as RLHF Representative projects: Profiling our reinforcement learning pipeline to find opportunities for improvement Building a system that regularly launches training jobs in a test environment so that we can quickly detect problems in the training pipeline Making changes to our finetuning systems so they work on new model architectures Building instrumentation to detect and eliminate Python GIL contention in our training code Diagnosing why training runs have started slowing down after some number of steps, and fixing it Implementing a stable, fast version of a new training algorithm proposed by a researcher Deadline to apply: None. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis. The expected base compensation for this position is below. Our total compensation package for full-time employees includes equity, benefits, and may include incentive compensation.Annual Salary:$300,000 - $405,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.

We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research.

How can we trust them?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Interpretability team at Anthropic is working to reverse-engineer how trained models work because we believe that a mechanistic understanding is the most robust way to make advanced systems safe. We’re looking for researchers and engineers to join our efforts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;People mean many different things by &quot;interpretability&quot;. We&#39;re focused on mechanistic interpretability, which aims to discover how neural network parameters map to meaningful algorithms. Some useful analogies might be to think of us as trying to do &quot;biology&quot; or &quot;neuroscience&quot; of neural networks using “microscopes” we build, or as treating neural networks as binary computer programs we&#39;re trying to &quot;reverse engineer&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;A few places to learn more about our work and team at a high level are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxhhMTOTMDg&quot;&gt;this introduction to Interpretability&lt;/a&gt; from our research lead, &lt;a href=&quot;https://colah.github.io/about.html&quot;&gt;Chris Olah&lt;/a&gt;; a &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/episode/5UF79Uu94ia0fwC32a89LU&quot;&gt;discussion of our work&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/column/hard-fork&quot;&gt;Hard Fork podcast&lt;/a&gt; produced by the New York Times, and this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/research/engineering-challenges-interpretability&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; (and accompanying video) sharing more about some of the engineering challenges we’d had to solve to get these results. Some of our team&#39;s notable publications include &lt;a href=&quot;https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html&quot;&gt;A Mathematical Framework for Transformer Circuits&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/in-context-learning-and-induction-heads/index.html&quot;&gt;In-context Learning and Induction Heads&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/toy_model/index.html&quot;&gt;Toy Models of Superposition&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://transformer-circuits.pub/2024/scaling-monosemanticity/&quot;&gt;Scaling Monosemanticity&lt;/a&gt;, and our Circuits’ &lt;a href=&quot;https://transformer-circuits.pub/2025/attribution-graphs/methods.html&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://transformer-circuits.pub/2025/attribution-graphs/biology.html&quot;&gt;Biology&lt;/a&gt; papers. This work builds on ideas from members&#39; work prior to Anthropic such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/&quot;&gt;original circuits thread&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://distill.pub/2021/multimodal-neurons/&quot;&gt;Multimodal Neurons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://distill.pub/2019/activation-atlas/&quot;&gt;Activation Atlases&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://distill.pub/2018/building-blocks/&quot;&gt;Building Blocks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We aim to create a solid foundation for mechanistically understanding neural networks and making them safe (see our &lt;a href=&quot;https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/interpretability-dreams/index.html&quot;&gt;vision post&lt;/a&gt;). In the short term, we have focused on resolving the issue of &quot;superposition&quot; (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/toy_model/index.html&quot;&gt;Toy Models of Superposition&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/toy-double-descent/index.html&quot;&gt;Superposition, Memorization, and Double Descent&lt;/a&gt;, and our &lt;a href=&quot;https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/may-update/index.html&quot;&gt;May 2023 update&lt;/a&gt;), which causes the computational units of the models, like neurons and attention heads, to be individually uninterpretable, and on finding ways to decompose models into more interpretable components. Our subsequent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/news/mapping-mind-language-model&quot;&gt;work&lt;/a&gt; found millions of features in Sonnet, one of our production language models, represents progress in this direction. In our most recent work, we develop methods that allow us to build circuits using features and use this circuits to understand the mechanisms associated with a model&#39;s computation and study specific examples of multi-hop reasoning, planning, and chain-of-thought faithfulness on Haiku 3.5, one of our production models.” This is a stepping stone towards our overall goal of mechanistically understanding neural networks.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We often collaborate with teams across Anthropic, such as Alignment Science and Societal Impacts to use our work to make Anthropic’s models safer.

We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications.

At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time.

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;About the role:&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When you see what modern language models are capable of, do you wonder, &quot;How do these things work? How can we trust them?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Interpretability team at Anthropic is working to reverse-engineer how trained models work because we believe that a mechanistic understanding is the most robust way to make advanced systems safe. We’re looking for researchers and engineers to join our efforts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;People mean many different things by &quot;interpretability&quot;. We&#39;re focused on mechanistic interpretability, which aims to discover how neural network parameters map to meaningful algorithms. Some useful analogies might be to think of us as trying to do &quot;biology&quot; or &quot;neuroscience&quot; of neural networks using “microscopes” we build, or as treating neural networks as binary computer programs we&#39;re trying to &quot;reverse engineer&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;A few places to learn more about our work and team at a high level are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxhhMTOTMDg&quot;&gt;this introduction to Interpretability&lt;/a&gt; from our research lead, &lt;a href=&quot;https://colah.github.io/about.html&quot;&gt;Chris Olah&lt;/a&gt;; a &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/episode/5UF79Uu94ia0fwC32a89LU&quot;&gt;discussion of our work&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/column/hard-fork&quot;&gt;Hard Fork podcast&lt;/a&gt; produced by the New York Times, and this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/research/engineering-challenges-interpretability&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; (and accompanying video) sharing more about some of the engineering challenges we’d had to solve to get these results. Some of our team&#39;s notable publications include &lt;a href=&quot;https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html&quot;&gt;A Mathematical Framework for Transformer Circuits&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/in-context-learning-and-induction-heads/index.html&quot;&gt;In-context Learning and Induction Heads&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/toy_model/index.html&quot;&gt;Toy Models of Superposition&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://transformer-circuits.pub/2024/scaling-monosemanticity/&quot;&gt;Scaling Monosemanticity&lt;/a&gt;, and our Circuits’ &lt;a href=&quot;https://transformer-circuits.pub/2025/attribution-graphs/methods.html&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://transformer-circuits.pub/2025/attribution-graphs/biology.html&quot;&gt;Biology&lt;/a&gt; papers.

In the short term, we have focused on resolving the issue of &quot;superposition&quot; (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/toy_model/index.html&quot;&gt;Toy Models of Superposition&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/toy-double-descent/index.html&quot;&gt;Superposition, Memorization, and Double Descent&lt;/a&gt;, and our &lt;a href=&quot;https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/may-update/index.html&quot;&gt;May 2023 update&lt;/a&gt;), which causes the computational units of the models, like neurons and attention heads, to be individually uninterpretable, and on finding ways to decompose models into more interpretable components.

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;About the role:&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When you see what modern language models are capable of, do you wonder, &quot;How do these things work? How can we trust them?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Interpretability team at Anthropic is working to reverse-engineer how trained models work because we believe that a mechanistic understanding is the most robust way to make advanced systems safe. We’re looking for researchers and engineers to join our efforts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;People mean many different things by &quot;interpretability&quot;. We&#39;re focused on mechanistic interpretability, which aims to discover how neural network parameters map to meaningful algorithms. Some useful analogies might be to think of us as trying to do &quot;biology&quot; or &quot;neuroscience&quot; of neural networks using “microscopes” we build, or as treating neural networks as binary computer programs we&#39;re trying to &quot;reverse engineer&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A few places to learn more about our work and team at a high level are &lt;a class=&quot;text-accent-secondary-100 underline&quot; href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxhhMTOTMDg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this introduction to Interpretability&lt;/a&gt; from our research lead, &lt;a class=&quot;text-accent-secondary-100 underline&quot; href=&quot;https://colah.github.io/about.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Chris Olah&lt;/a&gt;; a &lt;a class=&quot;text-accent-secondary-100 underline&quot; href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/episode/5UF79Uu94ia0fwC32a89LU&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;discussion of our work&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a class=&quot;text-accent-secondary-100 underline&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/column/hard-fork&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hard Fork podcast&lt;/a&gt; produced by the New York Times, and this &lt;a class=&quot;text-accent-secondary-100 underline&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/research/engineering-challenges-interpretability&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; (and accompanying video) sharing more about some of the engineering challenges we’d had to solve to get these results.

In the short term, we have focused on resolving the issue of &quot;superposition&quot; (see &lt;a class=&quot;text-accent-secondary-100 underline&quot; href=&quot;https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/toy_model/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Toy Models of Superposition&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;text-accent-secondary-100 underline&quot; href=&quot;https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/toy-double-descent/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Superposition, Memorization, and Double Descent&lt;/a&gt;, and our &lt;a class=&quot;text-accent-secondary-100 underline&quot; href=&quot;https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/may-update/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;May 2023 update&lt;/a&gt;), which causes the computational units of the models, like neurons and attention heads, to be individually uninterpretable, and on finding ways to decompose models into more interpretable components. Our subsequent &lt;a class=&quot;text-accent-secondary-100 underline&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/news/mapping-mind-language-model&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;work&lt;/a&gt; found millions of features in Sonnet, one of our production language models, represents progress in this direction. In our most recent work, we develop methods that allow us to build circuits using features and use this circuits to understand the mechanisms associated with a model&#39;s computation and study specific examples of multi-hop reasoning, planning, and chain-of-thought faithfulness on Haiku 3.5, one of our production models.” This is a stepping stone towards our overall goal of mechanistically understanding neural networks.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We often collaborate with teams across Anthropic, such as Alignment Science and Societal Impacts to use our work to make Anthropic’s models safer.

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;About the role:&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When you see what modern language models are capable of, do you wonder, &quot;How do these things work? How can we trust them?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Interpretability team at Anthropic is working to reverse-engineer how trained models work because we believe that a mechanistic understanding is the most robust way to make advanced systems safe. We’re looking for researchers and engineers to join our efforts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;People mean many different things by &quot;interpretability&quot;. We&#39;re focused on mechanistic interpretability, which aims to discover how neural network parameters map to meaningful algorithms. Some useful analogies might be to think of us as trying to do &quot;biology&quot; or &quot;neuroscience&quot; of neural networks using “microscopes” we build, or as treating neural networks as binary computer programs we&#39;re trying to &quot;reverse engineer&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A few places to learn more about our work and team at a high level are &lt;a class=&quot;text-accent-secondary-100 underline&quot; href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxhhMTOTMDg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this introduction to Interpretability&lt;/a&gt; from our research lead, &lt;a class=&quot;text-accent-secondary-100 underline&quot; href=&quot;https://colah.github.io/about.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Chris Olah&lt;/a&gt;; a &lt;a class=&quot;text-accent-secondary-100 underline&quot; href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/episode/5UF79Uu94ia0fwC32a89LU&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;discussion of our work&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a class=&quot;text-accent-secondary-100 underline&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/column/hard-fork&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hard Fork podcast&lt;/a&gt; produced by the New York Times, and this &lt;a class=&quot;text-accent-secondary-100 underline&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/research/engineering-challenges-interpretability&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; (and accompanying video) sharing more about some of the engineering challenges we’d had to solve to get these results.

This work builds on ideas from members&#39; work prior to Anthropic such as the &lt;a class=&quot;text-accent-secondary-100 underline&quot; href=&quot;https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;original circuits thread&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;text-accent-secondary-100 underline&quot; href=&quot;https://distill.pub/2021/multimodal-neurons/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Multimodal Neurons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;text-accent-secondary-100 underline&quot; href=&quot;https://distill.pub/2019/activation-atlas/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Activation Atlases&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a class=&quot;text-accent-secondary-100 underline&quot; href=&quot;https://distill.pub/2018/building-blocks/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Building Blocks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We aim to create a solid foundation for mechanistically understanding neural networks and making them safe (see our &lt;a class=&quot;text-accent-secondary-100 underline&quot; href=&quot;https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/interpretability-dreams/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;vision post&lt;/a&gt;). In the short term, we have focused on resolving the issue of &quot;superposition&quot; (see &lt;a class=&quot;text-accent-secondary-100 underline&quot; href=&quot;https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/toy_model/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Toy Models of Superposition&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;text-accent-secondary-100 underline&quot; href=&quot;https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/toy-double-descent/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Superposition, Memorization, and Double Descent&lt;/a&gt;, and our &lt;a class=&quot;text-accent-secondary-100 underline&quot; href=&quot;https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/may-update/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;May 2023 update&lt;/a&gt;), which causes the computational units of the models, like neurons and attention heads, to be individually uninterpretable, and on finding ways to decompose models into more interpretable components. Our subsequent &lt;a class=&quot;text-accent-secondary-100 underline&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/news/mapping-mind-language-model&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;work&lt;/a&gt; found millions of features in Sonnet, one of our production language models, represents progress in this direction. In our most recent work, we develop methods that allow us to build circuits using features and use this circuits to understand the mechanisms associated with a model&#39;s computation and study specific examples of multi-hop reasoning, planning, and chain-of-thought faithfulness on Haiku 3.5, one of our production models.” This is a stepping stone towards our overall goal of mechanistically understanding neural networks.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We often collaborate with teams across Anthropic, such as Alignment Science and Societal Impacts to use our work to make Anthropic’s models safer.

We&#39;re inventing the field as we work, and the first textbook is years away&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You view research and engineering as two sides of the same coin. Every team member writes code, designs and runs experiments, and interprets results&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You can clearly articulate and discuss the motivations behind your work, and teach us about what you&#39;ve learned. You like writing up and communicating your results, even when they&#39;re null&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the skills we look for and how to prepare for this role, see our blog post – &lt;a class=&quot;text-accent-secondary-100 underline&quot; href=&quot;https://transformer-circuits.pub/2025/april-update/index.html#work&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;So You Want to Work in Mechanistic Interpretability?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Familiarity with Python is required for this role.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Role Specific Location Policy:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This role is based in San Francisco office; however, we are open to considering exceptional candidates for remote work on a case-by-case basis.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expected&amp;nbsp;base compensation for this position is below.

However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research.

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic&#39;s research teams are pushing the boundaries of AI safety and capability research, and they need exceptional tools to do their best work. As a Software Engineer on the Research Tools team, you&#39;ll build the infrastructure and applications that enable our researchers to iterate quickly, run complex experiments, and extract insights from frontier AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This role sits at the intersection of product thinking and full-stack engineering. You&#39;ll work directly with researchers and engineers to deeply understand their workflows, identify bottlenecks, and rapidly ship solutions that multiply their productivity. Whether you&#39;re building human feedback interfaces for model evaluation, creating platforms for experiment orchestration, or developing novel visualization tools for understanding model behavior, your work will directly accelerate our mission to build safe, reliable AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re looking for someone who can operate with high agency in an ambiguous environment—someone who can be dropped into a research team, quickly develop domain expertise, and independently drive impactful projects from conception to delivery.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;No ML or Research experience is required&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2

development&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Excel at rapid iteration and shipping—you can move from concept to working prototype quickly&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Have experience building tools, platforms, or infrastructure for technical users (engineers, researchers, data scientists, analysts, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Demonstrate high agency and ability to operate independently in ambiguous environments&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Can quickly develop deep understanding of complex technical

However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco.

At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco.

At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco.

Strong candidates will have a track record of solving large-scale systems problems and low-level optimization.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You may be a good fit if you:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have significant experience optimizing ML systems for TPUs, GPUs, or other accelerators&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are results-oriented, with a bias towards flexibility and impact&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Pick up slack, even if it goes outside your job description&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Enjoy pair programming (we love to pair!)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Want to learn more about machine learning research&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Care about the societal impacts of your work&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong candidates may also have experience with:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;High performance, large-scale ML systems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Designing and implementing kernels for TPUs or other ML accelerators&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Understanding accelerators at a deep level, e.g. a background in computer architecture&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;ML framework internals&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Language modeling with transformers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Representative projects:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Implement low-latency, high-throughput sampling for large language models&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Adapt existing models for low-precision inference&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build quantitative models of system performance&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Design and implement custom collective communication algorithms&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Debug kernel performance at the assembly level&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expected&amp;nbsp;base compensation for this position is below.

However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

      "description": "&lt;div class=&quot;content-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Figma is growing our team of passionate creatives and builders on a mission to make design accessible to all. Figma’s platform helps teams bring ideas to life—whether you&#39;re brainstorming, creating a prototype, translating designs into code, or iterating with AI. From idea to product, Figma empowers teams to streamline workflows, move faster, and work together in real time from anywhere in the world. If you&#39;re excited to shape the future of design and collaboration, join us!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re looking for product designers who are excited to shape how teams build together. At Figma, design isn’t just how something looks—it’s how it works, how it feels, and how it scales. Our designers are systems thinkers, prototypers, storytellers, and craftspeople who care deeply about quality and collaboration. In this role, you’ll turn ambiguity into clarity, push the product forward with engineers, PMs, and researchers, and help us invent new ways for people to express ideas, share work, and design together—whether they’re exploring concepts, building their ideas, or scaling design systems. Our culture is oriented around growth, and learning from each other to improve how we work is central to how we operate. If you’re driven by impact, care about craft, and are excited to shape the tools that design teams rely on every day, we’d love to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This opportunity applies to openings of varying seniority levels across our product suite–including FigJam, Figma Slides, Figma Sites, Figma Buzz, and our cross-product initiatives. We’ll discuss more specifics about open roles during the interview process.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a full time role that can be held from one of our US hubs or remotely in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you&#39;ll do at Figma:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Contribute to overall strategy and decision-making about product direction&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Help deliver and refine clear storytelling around product needs and opportunities&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Work cross-functionally with product management, engineering, design, and research peers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Create and iterate on flows, prototypes, and high-fidelity visuals, as well as provide thoughtful feedback for others doing the same so you can all do your best work&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Design and ship high-quality product improvements&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Contribute to our design org’s culture by participating in design critiques, mentoring peers, and sharing best practices across teams&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’d love to hear from you if you have:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;3+ years of work experience designing UX and UI for a software product of similar scale and complexity&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Great attention to detail and a strong eye for visual craft, such as composition, typography, and layout&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Fluency in interaction design and prototyping, to express and refine nuanced design decisions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A track record of independently driving design processes from discovery through launch—balancing user needs, technical constraints, and business goals&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The ability to guide decision-making with structured thinking, clearly articulated rationale, and user-centered research&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While it’s not required, it’s an added plus if you also have:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience designing creative tools, workflows, or systems that support collaboration&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience researching, prototyping, or building products with AI and other emerging tools to uncover new patterns for creativity and collaboration&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At Figma, one of our values is Grow as you go. We believe in hiring smart, curious people who are excited to learn and develop their skills. If you’re excited about this role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with the points outlined in the job description, we encourage you to apply anyways. You may be just the right candidate for this or other roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 16px;&quot;&gt;Pay Transparency Disclosure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If based in Figma’s San Francisco or New York hub offices, this role has the annual base salary range stated below.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Job level and actual compensation will be decided based on factors including, but not limited to, individual qualifications objectively assessed during the interview process (including skills and prior relevant experience, potential impact, and scope of role), market demands, and specific work location.

      "job_description": "ABOUT CLERK\n\nClerk is on a mission to solve user management once and for all. We are a globally distributed team dedicated to providing best-in-class developer experience, with obsessive attention to every detail. Today, we provide developers with full-stack React components and hooks like <SignUp/> https://clerk.dev/components/sign-up, <SignIn/> https://clerk.dev/components/sign-in, <UserProfile/> https://clerk.dev/components/user-profile, useUser https://clerk.com/docs/references/react/use-user, and useOrganization https://clerk.com/docs/references/react/use-organization. These APIs allow developers to build hard-to-get-right user and organization management flows. We believe that a component is worth a thousand APIs https://youtube.com/watch?v=enUuBY3HXh4.\n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE\n\nClerk is looking for engineering-minded Product Manager to help us bring new functionality to the Clerk platform, specifically our Billing product. This role will have you work on nimble teams and connect directly with customers to define and execute functionality that developers love and support builders launching and growing their businesses.\n\n\nWHAT YOU'LL DO\n\nWe’re a small but growing team with big ambitions. This means you’ll have responsibility far beyond closing out pre-sliced tickets. We’re looking for people that are comfortable working across the stack to solve product problems for real users.\n\nWe will expect you to:\n\n - Collaborate with customers and teammates - be part of a world-class product delivery team that cares deeply about customer needs and the value of constant iteration. We’re fully remote, which means you’ll need to practice good communication habits to keep things moving.\n\n - Execute - Clerk values product people who execute. That means approaching all of your work iteratively and reducing the time between feedback cycles.\n\n - Thrive in a dynamic environment - Clerk is not well suited for product people who expect every task to be a series of predefined steps. We believe the best approach is to -work- through our customer’s problems in the trenches and not merely -think- through them from the sidelines.\n\n - Be Customer 0 - Clerk is built on top of Clerk. That means the work you do to solve our internal projects likely will also become functionality that we release to customers as well. This is one of the most unique and exciting parts of Clerk.\n\n - Be technical - Clerk is a collection of engineers doing engineering work, so that other engineers can do engineering work! Every staff member is expected to be as technical as the customers they are serving\n\n - Embrace a culture of craft https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4hP80tzBL4 by focusing on engineering quality. We want our product to be best-in-class, and so we need our team to write maintainable, performant, and well-structured code.\n\n\nWHO YOU ARE\n\n - You have experience making product decisions and driving a team forward, whether as an Engineer in the past or as a Product Designer.\n\n - You have experience with SaaS product monetization and pricing as a builder of a subscription product .\n\n - You understand the technical landscape of developer tools. We may not ask you to write production-grade code but you should be able to implement Clerk as a customer and empathize deeply with people building SaaS products, particularly front-end and the JS/TS market.\n\n - You’re a talented communicator and writer who understands the value of explaining complex topics simply.\n\n - You’ve had previous experiences that required you to fill gaps on a team. Sometimes that means being an ex-founder or being a driving force on a team that needed leadership.\n\n - You’re customer obsessed. You don’t overvalue your own ideas if they don’t match what is going to make your customer’s lives easier.\n\n - You believe in solving real customer problems, even if it means making tradeoffs behind the scenes.\n\n - You’re passionate about building for other engineers and obsess over making their experience better.\n\n - You care about craft in all it’s forms, such as product constraints, design polish, and engineering execution.\n\n - You love working on products you use yourself — because you know that’s how magic happens.\n\n - Ideally, you're based in the US timezones or open to working US hours.\n\n\nBENEFITS\n\n - Competitive Salary – We want you to know that we value the skills and experience you bring to the table. We go out of our way to make sure that you feel fairly compensated.\n\n - Equity Ownership – At Clerk, we believe in shared success. That's why we offer a stock option plan so that everyone can benefit from the growth and prosperity of the company.\n\n - Work Gear - Set up your ideal home office with the gear of your choice. At Clerk, we want to ensure that you have everything you need to perform at your best.\n\n - Flexible Vacation Policy – We believe in work-life balance and trust you to take the time you need. Although we recommend 25 days per year, our vacation policy is unlimited. This is in addition to observing national holidays specific to your country of residence.\n\n - Diverse and Inclusive Team – Join our exceptional, diverse, and globally distributed team at Clerk. We are committed to fostering an inclusive environment where everyone can contribute their best in building impactful products and tools for the modern web.",

      "description": "About Us\n\nHighLevel is an AI powered, all-in-one white-label sales & marketing platform that empowers agencies, entrepreneurs, and businesses to elevate their digital presence and drive growth. We are proud to support a global and growing community of over 2 million businesses, including agencies, consultants, and businesses of all sizes and industries. HighLevel empowers users  with all the tools needed to capture, nurture, and close new leads into repeat customers. As of mid 2025, HighLevel processes over 4 billion API hits and handles more than 2.5 billion message events every day. Our platform manages over 470 terabytes of data distributed across five databases, operates with a network of over 250 microservices, and supports over 1 million hostnames.\n\nOur People\n\nWith over 1,500 team members across 15+ countries, we operate in a global, remote-first environment. We are building more than software; we are building a global community rooted in creativity, collaboration, and impact. We take pride in cultivating a culture where innovation thrives, ideas are celebrated, and people come first, no matter where they call home.\n\nOur Impact\n\nAs of mid 2025, our platform powers over 1.5 billion messages, helps generate over 200 million leads, and facilitates over 20 million conversations for the more than 2 million businesses we serve each month. Behind those numbers are real people growing their companies, connecting with customers, and making their mark - and we get to help make that happen.Learn more about us on our YouTube Channel or Blog Posts\n\nWho You Are\n\nWe’re launching HighLevel Local Chapters around the world — a global network of in-person communities designed to make it easier than ever for our growing ecosystem to connect, learn, and grow together locally. \n\nEach local chapter will serve as a hub where HighLevel users, agency owners, and ecosystem partners come together once a month for networking, shared learning, and meaningful connection with like-minded entrepreneurs. \n\nWe’re looking for an experienced, people-first Community Manager for our local chapter to design, launch, and scale this global community program. You’ll build the infrastructure, systems, and playbook that empower local leaders to host consistent, high-quality events that strengthen our global network, city by city. \n\nStarting with the Dallas pilot, you’ll establish the blueprint for how local chapters operate: from regular meetups and leadership roles to community guidelines and event programming. You’ll recruit, train, and support local chapter leads, and create a scalable model for national and international expansion. \n\nYou’ll also host HighLevel’s annual Local Chapter Day — a 1–2 day global gathering that brings chapter leaders together for connection, training, and alignment. \n\nThis is a high-visibility, relationship-driven role that blends event strategy, community building, and program management. You’ll be the face of HighLevel’s local community network — comfortable on stage, passionate about people, and driven to inspire connection across the world.\n",

Our team draws experience from SpaceX, Palantir, Anduril, Applied Intuition, and other leading companies — united by a common mission: enabling hardware engineers to push the boundaries of advanced technology with speed, safety, and precision.\n\nJoin Nominal as a Full-Stack Engineer and help build a product that powers how hardware engineers interact and validate complex, high-volume telemetry. You’ll work across the stack, from scalable back-end services that can compute and transform telemetry data to complex, highly performant web interfaces. You’ll collaborate closely with product, design, and infrastructure teams, shaping intuitive, reliable, and data-driven experiences from database to user interface. Ideal candidates have 3+ years of full-stack experience, an ability to reason through complex system architecture, a strong eye for intuitive UX for complex workflows, and a passion for turning technical challenges into seamless, impactful tools.\n",

It’s a highlight of our year.\n\n - Flexible Work\n   \n   We operate asynchronously and trust you to manage your own time. You know what needs to be done and when.\n\n - Professional Development\n   \n   Every team member receives an annual education allowance to spend on learning—courses, books, conferences, or anything that supports your growth.\n\n\nABOUT THE TEAM\n\nSupabase was born-remote and open-source-first. We believe our globally distributed team is our secret weapon in building tools developers love.\n\n - 180+ team members\n\n - 40+ countries\n\n - 15+ languages spoken\n\n - $496M raised\n\n - 430,000+ community members\n\n - 30,000+ memes posted (and counting)\n\nWe move fast, build in public, and use what we ship. If it’s in your project, we probably use it in ours too. We believe deeply in the open-source ecosystem and strive to support—not replace—existing tools and communities.\n\n\nHIRING PROCESS\n\nWe keep things simple, async-friendly, and respectful of your time:\n\n 1. Apply – Our team will review your application.\n\n 2. Intro Call – A short video chat to get to know each other.\n\n 3. Interviews – Up to four calls with:\n    \n    - Founders\n    \n    - Future teammates\n    \n    - Someone cross-functional from product, growth, or engineering (depending on the role)\n\n 4. Decision – We may follow up with a final question or go straight to offer.\n\nAll communication is remote and we aim to move fast.",

Linkedin makes us show a country, but we hire the best people wherever they are.\n\nAt Railway, we take the complexity out of shipping software. We aim to make developers more effective by allowing them to ship their code without any fuss — write your code, push it to us, and we deliver it to your end-users. We’re the Railway that takes your code from A to Z in a straight line: no transfers, no mad scrambling for boarding, no chaos in your journey.\n\nThis is a hybrid user-facing role with some full-stack engineering elements. Learn more in our blog post at Support Engineering is Engineering https://blog.railway.app/p/support-engineering-is-engineering. The sister role for this is Senior Software Engineer, Support https://railway.com/careers/senior-software-engineer-support.\n\nWant to learn about our work culture? Here is a four-part blog series that will help you see the unique ways our team works (Parts 1 https://blog.railway.app/p/how-we-work, 2 https://blog.railway.app/p/how-we-work-volume-ii, 3 https://blog.railway.app/p/how-we-work-volume-iii, and 4 https://blog.railway.com/p/how-we-work-volume-iv).\n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE\n\n 1. Be the voice of the customer, aggregating their passionate concerns into actionable product outcomes.\n\n 2. Translate customer reports into actionable insights, surface patterns from individual issues, and ensure critical problems reach the right team with proper context.\n\n 3. Create written content for internal and external audiences by writing documentation, runbooks, and customer communications that make infrastructure feel approachable.\n\n 4. Understand the technical landscape our users are coming from and the relief they feel when Railway just works.\n\n\nABOUT YOU\n\n 1. Native proficiency in English language. Effective writing and communication skills with a personable nature; able to distill difficult technical concepts to a wide range of users\n\n 2. An understanding that behind every deployment failure is a customer’s stress level spiking, and you can navigate both the technical debugging and the human reassurance needed to make things right\n\n 3. An understanding of containers, deployment pipelines, databases, and cloud services well enough to quickly diagnose issues and guide users to solutions.\n\n 4. Deployed apps, wrestled with databases, and debugged mysterious failures. You know enough to speak the same language as our users and diagnose where things went sideways.\n\n 5. A mindset for pattern recognition. See three similar tickets and immediately start connecting dots. Is this a UI confusion? A missing feature? A bug that only happens on Tuesdays? You're constantly surfacing insights that help us fix problems at their root.\n\n 6. The ability to remain the calm expert who makes problems feel solvable; you can context-switch between five different crisis modes while keeping each customer feeling like they're your only priority.\n\nThis role, in our opinion, is perfect for folks who have done tours in Technical Support, Developer Advocacy, or Engineering roles where you worked closely with users.\n\nWe don’t require you to check every box on the list, and we generally prefer working with people that are hungry for knowledge in areas they feel they’re lacking in. Please don’t hesitate to shoot us an application if you find Railway and the role interesting!\n\nWe value and love to work with diverse persons from all backgrounds\n\nThings to know\n\nFor better or worse, we're a startup; our team dynamics are different from companies of different sizes and stages.\n\n - We're distributed ALL across the globe, and that's only going to be more and more distributed. As a result, stuff is ALWAYS happening.\n\n - We do NOT expect you to work all the time, but you'll have to be diligent about your boundaries because the end of your day may overlap with the start of someone else's.\n\n - We're a small team, with high ownership, who are not only passionate about what we do, but seek to be exceptional as well. At the time of writing we're 21, serving hundreds of thousands of users. There's a lot of stuff going on, and a lot of ambiguity.\n\n - We want you to own it. We believe that ownership is a key to growth, and part of that growth is not only being able to make the choices, but owning the success, or failure, that comes with those choices.\n\nBenefits and perks\n\nAt Railway, we provide best in class benefits. Great salary, full health benefits including dependents, strong equity grants, equipment stipend, and much more. For more details, check back on the main careers page https://railway.app/careers/full-stack.\n\nBeyond compensation, there are a few things that we believe that make working at Railway truly unique:\n\n - Autonomy: We have very few meetings. Just a Monday and a Friday to go over the Company Board. We think your time is sacred, whether it's at work, or outside of work.\n\n - Ownership: We're a company with a high ownership, high autonomy culture. We hope that you'll come in, help us, and over the course of many years do the best work of your life. When we bring you onboard, we expect you to change the company.\n\n - Novel problems/solutions: We're a startup that's well funded, with cool problems, which lets us implement novel solutions! We abhor “busywork” and think, whether it's community, engineering, operations, etc there's always opportunity for creative and high leverage solutions.\n\n - Growth: We want you to grow with us, but we know that talent is loaned, so when you figure out what area you want to grow in next, whether it's at Railway or outside, we'll make sure you land there.\n\nHow we hire\n\nNo tricks. No surprises. Here's the entire process:\n\n 1. Talk with us about the role\n    \n    - This is completely open ended and we're just trying to see who you are, what you want to do, and where you wanna go.\n\n 2. Work on a small project to discuss in the interview\n    \n    - Asynchronously implement the following:\n      \n      - Go to https://station.railway.com/bounties\n      \n      - Answer up to 5 questions and link them to us\n      \n      - We’ll review the questions in the interview\n\n 3. Review your solution with the Team\n    \n    1. You'll sit down with someone on the team and go over the above. We'll poke into your solution, as well as get you acquainted with a member of the team.\n\n 4. Meet the Team\n    \n    1. You'll meet the Team, which will be comprised of 4 people from vastly different sections of the company.\n       \n       1. Looking for: How you work with the rest of the team and communicate.\n\n 5. Offer and Details Chat with CEO\n    \n    1.

Then, implement one workflow to illustrate your idea—using either Figma screens, a clickable prototype, or code.\n    \n    2. Deliverable: One workflow in Figma screens, a Figma prototype, or an implementation in code that communicates your vision and design quality.\n    \n    3.

      "job_description": "Supabase is the Postgres development platform, built by developers for developers. We provide a complete backend solution including Database, Auth, Storage, Edge Functions, Realtime, and Vector Search. All services are deeply integrated and designed for growth.\n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE\n\nWe’re looking for a Senior Postgres Engineer to join our Postgres Team and help maintain and expand the stability and functionality of our hosted Postgres offering . You’ll work closely with customers, partners, product, engineering, support and success, helping us maintain a secure, stable, performant, and functional Postgres foundation.\n\nThis role is ideal for someone who thrives in async, fast-paced environments and is excited about building developer tools that scale to millions.\n\n\nWHAT YOU’LL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR\n\nWe need a senior PostgreSQL engineer who brings deep knowledge of PostgreSQL internals and hands-on experience building extensions in C and Rust. You should understand how PostgreSQL works under the hood - from the parser and planner to WAL mechanics and MVCC implementation. Strong troubleshooting skills for managed PostgreSQL deployments are crucial, including diagnosing issues with custom extensions, analyzing core dumps, and resolving performance problems. You should be comfortable building testing and owning idempotent deployment to many thousands of running postgres instances. You'll work with complex extension ecosystems and need to understand extension compatibility, upgrade paths, and potential conflicts. Experience with PostgreSQL's background worker framework, shared memory management, and hook system is important for this role.\n\n\nYOU MIGHT BE A GOOD FIT IF YOU\n\n - Have 5+ years of experience postgres security, encryption, RLS and permissions\n\n - Communicate clearly across both technical and non-technical audiences\n\n - Have experience in async or globally distributed teams\n\n - Are energized by solving real-world problems for developers\n\n - Are comfortable navigating ambiguity and moving quickly\n\n\nWHAT WE OFFER\n\n - Fully Remote\n   \n   We hire globally. We believe you can do your best work from anywhere. There are no Supabase offices, but we provide a WeWork membership or co-working allowance you can use anywhere in the world.\n\n - ESOP\n   \n   Every team member receives ESOP (equity ownership) in the company. We want everyone to share in the upside of what we’re building together.\n\n - Tech Allowance\n   \n   Use this budget to set up your ideal work environment—laptop, monitor, headphones, or whatever helps you do your best work.\n\n - Health Benefits\n   \n   Supabase covers 100% of health insurance for employees and 80% for dependents, wherever you are. Your wellbeing and your family’s health are important to us.\n\n - Annual Off-Sites\n   \n   Once a year, the entire company gathers in a new city for a week of connection, collaboration, and fun. It’s a highlight of our year.\n\n - Flexible Work\n   \n   We operate asynchronously and trust you to manage your own time. You know what needs to be done and when.\n\n - Professional Development\n   \n   Every team member receives an annual education allowance to spend on learning—courses, books, conferences, or anything that supports your growth.\n\n\nABOUT THE TEAM\n\nSupabase was born-remote and open-source-first. We believe our globally distributed team is our secret weapon in building tools developers love.\n\n - 180+ team members\n\n - 40+ countries\n\n - 15+ languages spoken\n\n - $496M raised\n\n - 430,000+ community members\n\n - 30,000+ memes posted (and counting)\n\nWe move fast, build in public, and use what we ship. If it’s in your project, we probably use it in ours too. We believe deeply in the open-source ecosystem and strive to support—not replace—existing tools and communities.\n\n\nHIRING PROCESS\n\nWe keep things simple, async-friendly, and respectful of your time:\n\n 1. Apply – Our team will review your application.\n\n 2. Intro Call – A short video chat to get to know each other.\n\n 3. Interviews – Up to four calls with:\n    \n    - Founders\n    \n    - Future teammates\n    \n    - Someone cross-functional from product, growth, or engineering (depending on the role)\n\n 4. Decision – We may follow up with a final question or go straight to offer.\n\nAll communication is remote and we aim to move fast.",

      "description": "Supabase is the Postgres development platform, built by developers for developers. We provide a complete backend solution including Database, Auth, Storage, Edge Functions, Realtime, and Vector Search. All services are deeply integrated and designed for growth.\n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE\n\nWe’re looking for a Senior Postgres Engineer to join our Postgres Team and help maintain and expand the stability and functionality of our hosted Postgres offering . You’ll work closely with customers, partners, product, engineering, support and success, helping us maintain a secure, stable, performant, and functional Postgres foundation.\n\nThis role is ideal for someone who thrives in async, fast-paced environments and is excited about building developer tools that scale to millions.\n\n\nWHAT YOU’LL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR\n\nWe need a senior PostgreSQL engineer who brings deep knowledge of PostgreSQL internals and hands-on experience building extensions in C and Rust. You should understand how PostgreSQL works under the hood - from the parser and planner to WAL mechanics and MVCC implementation. Strong troubleshooting skills for managed PostgreSQL deployments are crucial, including diagnosing issues with custom extensions, analyzing core dumps, and resolving performance problems. You should be comfortable building testing and owning idempotent deployment to many thousands of running postgres instances. You'll work with complex extension ecosystems and need to understand extension compatibility, upgrade paths, and potential conflicts. Experience with PostgreSQL's background worker framework, shared memory management, and hook system is important for this role.\n\n\nYOU MIGHT BE A GOOD FIT IF YOU\n\n - Have 5+ years of experience postgres security, encryption, RLS and permissions\n\n - Communicate clearly across both technical and non-technical audiences\n\n - Have experience in async or globally distributed teams\n\n - Are energized by solving real-world problems for developers\n\n - Are comfortable navigating ambiguity and moving quickly\n\n\nWHAT WE OFFER\n\n - Fully Remote\n   \n   We hire globally. We believe you can do your best work from anywhere. There are no Supabase offices, but we provide a WeWork membership or co-working allowance you can use anywhere in the world.\n\n - ESOP\n   \n   Every team member receives ESOP (equity ownership) in the company. We want everyone to share in the upside of what we’re building together.\n\n - Tech Allowance\n   \n   Use this budget to set up your ideal work environment—laptop, monitor, headphones, or whatever helps you do your best work.\n\n - Health Benefits\n   \n   Supabase covers 100% of health insurance for employees and 80% for dependents, wherever you are. Your wellbeing and your family’s health are important to us.\n\n - Annual Off-Sites\n   \n   Once a year, the entire company gathers in a new city for a week of connection, collaboration, and fun. It’s a highlight of our year.\n\n - Flexible Work\n   \n   We operate asynchronously and trust you to manage your own time. You know what needs to be done and when.\n\n - Professional Development\n   \n   Every team member receives an annual education allowance to spend on learning—courses, books, conferences, or anything that supports your growth.\n\n\nABOUT THE TEAM\n\nSupabase was born-remote and open-source-first. We believe our globally distributed team is our secret weapon in building tools developers love.\n\n - 180+ team members\n\n - 40+ countries\n\n - 15+ languages spoken\n\n - $496M raised\n\n - 430,000+ community members\n\n - 30,000+ memes posted (and counting)\n\nWe move fast, build in public, and use what we ship. If it’s in your project, we probably use it in ours too. We believe deeply in the open-source ecosystem and strive to support—not replace—existing tools and communities.\n\n\nHIRING PROCESS\n\nWe keep things simple, async-friendly, and respectful of your time:\n\n 1.

We provide a complete backend solution including Database, Auth, Storage, Edge Functions, Realtime, and Vector Search. All services are deeply integrated and designed for growth.\n\nWe're seeking a Brand Designer to join our team.\n\nAs a Brand Designer at Supabase, you’ll play a crucial role in shaping our visual storytelling across a variety of mediums, including decks, printed materials, YouTube content, and conference assets.

You’ll push creative boundaries and set high standards for visual communication that resonates with our audience.\n\nYou’ll have opportunities to lead, propose, and execute projects across various formats, from polished presentations to impactful print designs. Your contributions will help tell Supabase’s story in a way that is consistent and memorable.\n\nWe Need:\n\n - Design Expertise: Proficiency in design tools like Figma, Adobe Creative Suite (like InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop), and presentation tools (like Google Slides, Keynote, PowerPoint — maybe Figma Slides?).\n\n - Creative Storyteller: Ability to craft cohesive and engaging visual narratives for presentations, printed materials, and digital assets.\n\n - Multi-Channel Design Experience: Comfort designing across various formats, including print, video, and social media.\n\n - Collaboration and Communication: Excellent communication skills, with experience working with cross-functional teams, including Marketing, Sales, Product, and Events.\n\n - Brand Consistency: Strong understanding of branding principles, ensuring all materials adhere to Supabase’s visual identity and messaging.\n\n - Attention to Detail: High standards for design quality and consistency across all formats and channels.\n\n - Print enthusiast: You know what 300gsm vs 100gsm feels like.\n\nWhat We Don’t Need:\n\n - Lone Wolves: If you prefer to work independently without regular collaboration, this role isn’t for you.\n\n - Resistance to Feedback: Comfort with iterating based on feedback, data, and testing is key.\n\n - Narrow Focus: Comfort with a variety of projects and adaptability to work across digital, print, and video is essential.\n\n - Feature-Only Mindset: We prioritize cohesive storytelling and visual impact over isolated, unconnected designs.\n\n - Low Initiative: We’re looking for proactive, resourceful designers who bring ideas to the table.\n\n - “Re-do Everything” Approach: Focus on incremental improvements rather than overhauling everything at once.\n\n - Inflexibility: This role requires adaptability to changing requirements and team dynamics.\n\n\nWHAT WE OFFER\n\n - Fully Remote\n   \n   We hire globally. We believe you can do your best work from anywhere. There are no Supabase offices, but we provide a WeWork membership or co-working allowance you can use anywhere in the world.\n\n - ESOP\n   \n   Every team member receives ESOP (equity ownership) in the company. We want everyone to share in the upside of what we’re building together.\n\n - Tech Allowance\n   \n   Use this budget to set up your ideal work environment—laptop, monitor, headphones, or whatever helps you do your best work.\n\n - Health Benefits\n   \n   Supabase covers 100% of health insurance for employees and 80% for dependents, wherever you are. Your wellbeing and your family’s health are important to us.\n\n - Annual Off-Sites\n   \n   Once a year, the entire company gathers in a new city for a week of connection, collaboration, and fun. It’s a highlight of our year.\n\n - Flexible Work\n   \n   We operate asynchronously and trust you to manage your own time. You know what needs to be done and when.\n\n - Professional Development\n   \n   Every team member receives an annual education allowance to spend on learning—courses, books, conferences, or anything that supports your growth.\n\n\nABOUT THE TEAM\n\nSupabase was born-remote and open-source-first. We believe our globally distributed team is our secret weapon in building tools developers love.\n\n - 180+ team members\n\n - 40+ countries\n\n - 15+ languages spoken\n\n - $496M raised\n\n - 430,000+ community members\n\n - 30,000+ memes posted (and counting)\n\nWe move fast, build in public, and use what we ship. If it’s in your project, we probably use it in ours too. We believe deeply in the open-source ecosystem and strive to support—not replace—existing tools and communities.\n\n\nHIRING PROCESS\n\nWe keep things simple, async-friendly, and respectful of your time:\n\n 1. Apply – Our team will review your application.\n\n 2. Intro Call – A short video chat to get to know each other.\n\n 3.

Our platform ingests high-rate telemetry, validates complex autonomy software in real time, and enables engineers to iterate faster without sacrificing safety or precision. We’re a small, fast-moving team of engineers and operators who own problems end-to-end, work across disciplines, and thrive on challenges at the intersection of hardware and software.\n\nAs a dual-use platform, we serve top-tier commercial and defense customers, including the U.S. Navy, United States Air Force, Shield AI, and Anduril. We’re backed by Sequoia, General Catalyst, Founders Fund, Lux Capital, and Lightspeed Ventures. Our team draws experience from SpaceX, Palantir, Anduril, Applied Intuition, and other leading companies — united by a common mission: enabling hardware engineers to push the boundaries of advanced technology with speed, safety, and precision.\n\nIn this pivotal role, you'll deliver Nominal’s vision of providing continuous testing to the industrial base, equipping engineers to deploy capability at scale, in the shortest time possible. You’ll maintain deal ownership of large enterprise and strategic accounts, selling a modern software platform to hardware organizations. It’ll be your role to communicate how our technology fits into their existing stack and helps them meet their critical testing outcomes. You will also be counted on to shape the early sales team and its culture.\n",

We believe you can do your best work from anywhere. There are no Supabase offices, but we provide a WeWork membership or co-working allowance you can use anywhere in the world.\n\n - ESOP\n   \n   Every team member receives ESOP (equity ownership) in the company. We want everyone to share in the upside of what we’re building together.\n\n - Tech Allowance\n   \n   Use this budget to set up your ideal work environment—laptop, monitor, headphones, or whatever helps you do your best work.\n\n - Health Benefits\n   \n   Supabase covers 100% of health insurance for employees and 80% for dependents, wherever you are. Your wellbeing and your family’s health are important to us.\n\n - Annual Off-Sites\n   \n   Once a year, the entire company gathers in a new city for a week of connection, collaboration, and fun. It’s a highlight of our year.\n\n - Flexible Work\n   \n   We operate asynchronously and trust you to manage your own time. You know what needs to be done and when.\n\n - Professional Development\n   \n   Every team member receives an annual education allowance to spend on learning—courses, books, conferences, or anything that supports your growth.\n\n\nABOUT THE TEAM\n\nSupabase was born-remote and open-source-first.

We want everyone to share in the upside of what we’re building together.\n\n - Tech Allowance\n   \n   Use this budget to set up your ideal work environment—laptop, monitor, headphones, or whatever helps you do your best work.\n\n - Health Benefits\n   \n   Supabase covers 100% of health insurance for employees and 80% for dependents, wherever you are. Your wellbeing and your family’s health are important to us.\n\n - Annual Off-Sites\n   \n   Once a year, the entire company gathers in a new city for a week of connection, collaboration, and fun. It’s a highlight of our year.\n\n - Flexible Work\n   \n   We operate asynchronously and trust you to manage your own time. You know what needs to be done and when.\n\n - Professional Development\n   \n   Every team member receives an annual education allowance to spend on learning—courses, books, conferences, or anything that supports your growth.\n\n\nABOUT THE TEAM\n\nSupabase was born-remote and open-source-first.

      "job_description": "ABOUT CLERK\n\nClerk is on a mission to solve user management once and for all. We are a globally distributed team dedicated to providing best-in-class developer experience, with obsessive attention to every detail. Today, we provide developers with full-stack React components and hooks like <SignUp/> https://clerk.dev/components/sign-up, <SignIn/> https://clerk.dev/components/sign-in, <UserProfile/> https://clerk.dev/components/user-profile, useUser https://clerk.com/docs/references/react/use-user, and useOrganization https://clerk.com/docs/references/react/use-organization. These APIs allow developers to build hard-to-get-right user and organization management flows. We believe that a component is worth a thousand APIs https://youtube.com/watch?v=enUuBY3HXh4.\n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE\n\nClerk is looking for product-minded Software Engineers comfortable with Golang and ideally Typescript as well to help us build out our core authentication product. This backend-oriented, full-stack role will have you work on nimble teams and connect directly with customers to define and execute functionality that developers love and support builders launching and growing their businesses.\n\n\nWHAT YOU’LL DO\n\nWe’re a small but growing team with big ambitions. This means you’ll have responsibility far beyond closing out pre-written tickets. We’re looking for people that are comfortable working across the stack to solve complex product problems for real users.\n\n - Shape the Clerk authentication experience – Build, improve, and evolve Clerk’s beloved managed authentication product. Your work will directly influence how thousands of teams interact with Clerk daily.\n\n - Design and implement new product features – From features like advanced OAuth and MCP to secure session management to audit logs and observability, you’ll build new functionality that makes it easier for users to authenticate and for developers to manage their users at scale.\n\n - Improve usability and workflows – Partner with design and product to streamline the utility, clarity, and efficiency of the auth product so developers can stop worrying about auth entirely, and focus on building their own products.\n\n - Build for observability and transparency – Create data pipelines and tools that help developers understand authentication flows, diagnose issues, and gain confidence in the systems they’ve built with Clerk.\n\n - Collaborate with customers and teammates – Be part of a world-class product delivery team that cares deeply about customer needs and the value of constant iteration. We’re fully remote, which means you’ll need to practice good communication habits to keep things moving.\n\n - Execute – Clerk values engineers who execute. That means approaching work iteratively and reducing the time between feedback cycles.\n\n - Thrive in a dynamic environment – Clerk is not well suited for engineers who expect every task to be a series of predefined steps. We believe the best approach is to work through our customer’s problems in the trenches and not merely think through them from the sidelines.\n\n - Be Customer 0 – Clerk is built on top of Clerk. That means the work you do to solve our internal projects likely will also become functionality that we release to customers as well. We are looking for engineers who care deeply about product quality and want to back that up with their work.\n\n - Embrace a culture of craft by focusing on engineering quality. We want our product to be best-in-class, and so we need our team to write maintainable, performant, and well-structured code.\n\n\nWHO YOU ARE\n\n - You’re comfortable writing idiomatic Golang code and and ideally also know your way around modern frontend stacks (even if not a frontend expert). Our architecture is built on top of GCP and Cloudflare with a Golang backend and React/Typescript frontend.\n\n - You value building clean and performant APIs\n\n - Event-driven architectures, Pub/Sub patterns, and scaling challenges are familiar territory.\n\n - You set a high bar for code quality, system design, and performance — and you’re not afraid to fight for it.\n\n - You’re passionate about building for other engineers and obsess over making their experience better.\n\n - You believe in solving real customer problems, even if it means making tradeoffs behind the scenes.\n\n - You understand that the purity of your systems are second to the the outcomes they enable for our customers. The entire aim of Clerk is to take on complexity on their behalf. That can mean making tradeoffs to our own systems.\n\n - You love working on products you use yourself — because you know that’s how magic happens.\n\n\nBENEFITS\n\n - Competitive Salary – We want you to know that we value the skills and experience you bring to the table. We go out of our way to make sure that you feel fairly compensated.\n\n - Equity Ownership – At Clerk, we believe in shared success. That's why we offer a stock option plan so that everyone can benefit from the growth and prosperity of the company.\n\n - Work Gear - Set up your ideal home office with the gear of your choice. At Clerk, we want to ensure that you have everything you need to perform at your best.\n\n - Flexible Vacation Policy – We believe in work-life balance and trust you to take the time you need. Although we recommend 25 days per year, our vacation policy is unlimited. This is in addition to observing national holidays specific to your country of residence.\n\n - Diverse and Inclusive Team – Join our exceptional, diverse, and globally distributed team at Clerk. We are committed to fostering an inclusive environment where everyone can contribute their best in building impactful products and tools for the modern web.",

Our architecture is built on top of GCP and Cloudflare with a Golang backend and React/Typescript frontend.\n\n - You value building clean and performant APIs\n\n - Event-driven architectures, Pub/Sub patterns, and scaling challenges are familiar territory.\n\n - You set a high bar for code quality, system design, and performance — and you’re not afraid to fight for it.\n\n - You’re passionate about building for other engineers and obsess over making their experience better.\n\n - You believe in solving real customer problems, even if it means making tradeoffs behind the scenes.\n\n - You understand that the purity of your systems are second to the the outcomes they enable for our customers. The entire aim of Clerk is to take on complexity on their behalf. That can mean making tradeoffs to our own systems.\n\n - You love working on products you use yourself — because you know that’s how magic happens.\n\n\nBENEFITS\n\n - Competitive Salary – We want you to know that we value the skills and experience you bring to the table. We go out of our way to make sure that you feel fairly compensated.\n\n - Equity Ownership – At Clerk, we believe in shared success.

We provide a complete backend solution including Database, Auth, Storage, Edge Functions, Realtime, and Vector Search. All services are deeply integrated and designed for growth.\n\nWe’re looking for a Developer Relations Engineer to help more developers discover, learn, and build with Supabase. You’ll create high-impact content, build real-world projects, and represent Supabase across communities and events. If you’re equally energized by writing code and teaching others, this is the role for you.\n\n\nWHY THIS ROLE MATTERS\n\nSupabase is growing fast with 350,000+ developers, 1,000+ OSS contributors, and a thriving open source ecosystem. Our users are builders, startup founders, weekend hackers, and engineers scaling to millions of users. DevRel is how we meet them where they are: through content, community, and code.\n\nWe’re building a community of communities that brings together developers from many backgrounds, including first-time open source contributors. As a DevRel Engineer, you’ll be a bridge between Supabase and the broader developer ecosystem, helping people get started, go deep, and feel connected.\n\n\nWHAT YOU'LL DO\n\n - Make content\n   \n   Publish compelling technical content, especially video, to help developers learn Supabase quickly\n\n - Build demos and tutorials\n   \n   Ship real-world apps using Supabase and tools like Next.js, React, and Stripe.

You’ll be a visible and trusted voice of the platform\n\n - Support and grow the community\n   \n   Celebrate contributors, answer questions, highlight cool projects, and bring developer feedback to the team\n\n - Collaborate across the company\n   \n   Work with engineering, product, and growth to amplify launches, prioritize content, and reduce friction for new users\n\n\nYOU MIGHT BE A FIT IF:\n\n - You’ve built full-stack apps and enjoy sharing your knowledge\n\n - You create content that makes people want to open their code editor\n\n - You’re equally comfortable writing a video script and TypeScript\n\n - You’re energized by community whether it’s on Discord, Twitter, YouTube, or in person\n\n - You’re self-directed, organized, and excited to contribute to open source\n\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n\n - This role is based in San Francisco to support regular in-person devrel video shoots, attend local events, and be an active presence in the SF tech ecosystem.\n\n - Strong engineering skills, especially with JavaScript or TypeScript, Postgres, and modern frontend frameworks (React, Svelte, Vue, etc.)\n\n - Experience creating technical content (written or video)\n\n - Comfortable representing a product publicly (on camera, on stage, or online)\n\n\nBONUS POINTS IF YOU HAVE:\n\n - A growing audience on YouTube, Twitch, or Twitter\n\n - Prior experience in DevRel or open source\n\n - Have used (and loved) Supabase\n\n\nWHAT WE OFFER\n\n - Fully Remote\n   \n   We hire globally. We believe you can do your best work from anywhere. There are no Supabase offices, but we provide a WeWork membership or co-working allowance you can use anywhere in the world.\n\n - ESOP\n   \n   Every team member receives ESOP (equity ownership) in the company. We want everyone to share in the upside of what we’re building together.\n\n - Tech Allowance\n   \n   Use this budget to set up your ideal work environment—laptop, monitor, headphones, or whatever helps you do your best work.\n\n - Health Benefits\n   \n   Supabase covers 100% of health insurance for employees and 80% for dependents, wherever you are. Your wellbeing and your family’s health are important to us.\n\n - Annual Off-Sites\n   \n   Once a year, the entire company gathers in a new city for a week of connection, collaboration, and fun. It’s a highlight of our year.\n\n - Flexible Work\n   \n   We operate asynchronously and trust you to manage your own time. You know what needs to be done and when.\n\n - Professional Development\n   \n   Every team member receives an annual education allowance to spend on learning—courses, books, conferences, or anything that supports your growth.\n\n\nABOUT THE TEAM\n\nSupabase was born-remote and open-source-first. We believe our globally distributed team is our secret weapon in building tools developers love.\n\n - 180+ team members\n\n - 40+ countries\n\n - 15+ languages spoken\n\n - $496M raised\n\n - 430,000+ community members\n\n - 30,000+ memes posted (and counting)\n\nWe move fast, build in public, and use what we ship. If it’s in your project, we probably use it in ours too. We believe deeply in the open-source ecosystem and strive to support—not replace—existing tools and communities.\n\n\nHIRING PROCESS\n\nWe keep things simple, async-friendly, and respectful of your time:\n\n 1. Apply – Our team will review your application.\n\n 2. Intro Call – A short video chat to get to know each other.\n\n 3. Interviews – Up to four calls with:\n    \n    - Founders\n    \n    - Future teammates\n    \n    - Someone cross-functional from product, growth, or engineering (depending on the role)\n\n 4. Decision – We may follow up with a final question or go straight to offer.\n\nAll communication is remote and we aim to move fast.",

This team owns the critical systems that power project provisioning, scaling, and the compute that our users rely on every day.\n\nYou’ll work on the core platform that ensures Supabase can seamlessly scale across multiple regions, handle high-volume workloads, and provide low-latency, highly available compute services.\n\nYou'll design, build, and operate systems that are both robust and highly automated — enabling us to provision new projects reliably at scale, optimize resource utilization, and deliver a seamless experience to the 5M databases which we manage.\n\n\nWHAT YOU’LL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR:\n\n - Help build and maintain the Supabase Cloud offering;\n\n - Design and implement systems to provision, scale, and manage the multi-region compute workloads powering Supabase projects in Kubernetes\n\n - Maintain our Go-based Kubernetes operator that orchestrates distributed Postgres deployments\n\n - Design and implement robust deployment patterns for EKS and other Kubernetes platforms\n\n - Work with CSI drivers, persistent volumes, and cross-cloud networking to ensure data reliability and connectivity\n\n - Own the full lifecycle of compute orchestration: project creation, warm pools, autoscaling, smart region selection, resizing, and resource optimization;\n\n - Improve automation and observability across the compute stack to ensure high availability and performance;\n\n - Improve our system architecture to reduce costs while balancing security, reliability, and performance;\n\n - Collaborate cross-functionally with other teams to help leverage compute as a core platform offering;\n\n - Participate in on-call rotations, incident response, and post-incident reviews;\n\n - Resolve escalated support issues, while also identifying and resolving systemic issues across the platform.\n\n\nYOU MIGHT BE A FIT IF YOU HAVE:\n\n - Strong software engineering skills - Go and Typescript proficiency required, with experience building production-grade Kubernetes operators or controllers\n\n - Cloud Infrastructure knowledge - familiarity with AWS constructs is required, past experience using the AWS SDKs and IaC tools (Pulumi, Terraform, etc) to build and operate infrastructure is strongly preferred.\n\n - Deep Kubernetes expertise - Hands-on experience with Kubernetes internals, custom resources, and cloud-managed Kubernetes services (EKS, GKE, AKS)\n\n - Production operations mindset - track record of building reliable, observable, and maintainable systems\n\n - Ownership mindset - you thrive in being able to operate independently with high-level guidance\n\n\nWHAT WE OFFER\n\n - Fully Remote\n   \n   We hire globally. We believe you can do your best work from anywhere. There are no Supabase offices, but we provide a WeWork membership or co-working allowance you can use anywhere in the world.\n\n - ESOP\n   \n   Every team member receives ESOP (equity ownership) in the company. We want everyone to share in the upside of what we’re building together.\n\n - Tech Allowance\n   \n   Use this budget to set up your ideal work environment—laptop, monitor, headphones, or whatever helps you do your best work.\n\n - Health Benefits\n   \n   Supabase covers 100% of health insurance for employees and 80% for dependents, wherever you are. Your wellbeing and your family’s health are important to us.\n\n - Annual Off-Sites\n   \n   Once a year, the entire company gathers in a new city for a week of connection, collaboration, and fun.

We believe our globally distributed team is our secret weapon in building tools developers love.\n\n - 180+ team members\n\n - 40+ countries\n\n - 15+ languages spoken\n\n - $496M raised\n\n - 430,000+ community members\n\n - 30,000+ memes posted (and counting)\n\nWe move fast, build in public, and use what we ship.

As a result, stuff is ALWAYS happening.\n\n - We do NOT expect you to work all the time, but you'll have to be diligent about your boundaries because the end of your day may overlap with the start of someone else's.\n\n - We're a small team, with high ownership, who are not only passionate about what we do, but seek to be exceptional as well. At the time of writing we're 21, serving hundreds of thousands of users. There's a lot of stuff going on, and a lot of ambiguity.\n\n - We want you to own it. We believe that ownership is a key to growth, and part of that growth is not only being able to make the choices, but owning the success, or failure, that comes with those choices.\n\nBenefits and perks\n\nAt Railway, we provide best in class benefits. Great salary, full health benefits including dependents, strong equity grants, equipment stipend, and much more. For more details, check back on the main careers page https://railway.app/careers/full-stack.\n\nBeyond compensation, there are a few things that we believe that make working at Railway truly unique:\n\n - Autonomy: We have very few meetings. Just a Monday and a Friday to go over the Company Board. We think your time is sacred, whether it's at work, or outside of work.\n\n - Ownership: We're a company with a high ownership, high autonomy culture. We hope that you'll come in, help us, and over the course of many years do the best work of your life. When we bring you onboard, we expect you to change the company.\n\n - Novel problems/solutions: We're a startup that's well funded, with cool problems, which lets us implement novel solutions! We abhor “busywork” and think, whether it's community, engineering, operations, etc there's always opportunity for creative and high leverage solutions.\n\n - Growth: We want you to grow with us, but we know that talent is loaned, so when you figure out what area you want to grow in next, whether it's at Railway or outside, we'll make sure you land there.\n\nHow we hire\n\nNo tricks. No surprises. Here's the entire process:\n\n 1. Talk with us about the role\n    \n    - This is completely open ended and we're just trying to see who you are, what you want to do, and where you wanna go.\n\n 2. Work on a small project to discuss in the interview\n    \n    - Asynchronously implement the following:\n    \n    - Pre-interview: Design a datacenter procurement, buildout, and management process from scratch\n    \n    - You can, and SHOULD! ask us questions ahead of time.\n\n 3. Review your solution with the Team\n    \n    1. You'll sit down with someone on the team and go over the above. We'll poke into your solution, as well as get you acquainted with two more members of the team.\n       \n       1. Looking for: Learn about your problem solving skills. How you break down a problem and how you present a solution.\n    \n    2. Interview Structure (60 Minutes):\n       \n       1. Pre-work (before your interview): Complete your solution (advised)\n       \n       2. 0-5m: introduction\n       \n       3. 5-50m: Building (or expanding) your solution\n       \n       4. 50-60m: Questions on Railway/Tech/etc\n\n 4. Meet the Team\n    \n    1. You'll meet the Team, which will be comprised of 4 people from vastly different sections of the company.\n       \n       1. Looking for: How you work with the rest of the team and communicate.\n\n 5. Offer and Details Chat with CEO\n    \n    1. Finally, we will go over the process, the role, and hammer out the details about your position, onboarding, and all the deets.\n\n#Global",

      "job_description": "This is a remote position available anywhere in the world! Linkedin makes us show a country, but we hire the best people wherever they are.\n\nAt Railway, we make it extremely simple for engineers to deploy logic without thinking about servers. Our goal is to make developers orders of magnitude more efficient by becoming the operating system for modern development.\n\nDev Rel is an often misunderstood role, we see it as a hybrid of being able to make cool stuff and talking about it, but also being the tip of the spear in getting feedback from the market. You should be knowledgeable about modern DevOps practices, the state of the cloud infra world, while being opinionated about how the next 10 years of Dev Tools should look like.\n\nThis is a high impact, high agency role where you are given a high degree of autonomy to work with any function you desire while receiving any support from the team you need. As our first hire in this area, we expect you to wear a lot of hats while setting the strategy.\n\nWant to learn about our work culture? Here is a three-part blog series that will help you see the unique ways our team works (Parts 1 https://blog.railway.app/p/how-we-work, 2 https://blog.railway.app/p/how-we-work-volume-ii, 3 https://blog.railway.app/p/how-we-work-volume-iii, and 4 https://blog.railway.com/p/how-we-work-volume-iv).\n\nAbout the role\n\nFor this role, you will:\n\n - Implement programs to gather developer feedback and then exercise discretion on how to best communicate to those users\n\n - Build and refine product adoption loops through content, improvements to the product, and nurturing community\n\n - Assist the team on initiatives around our Open Source presence such as our CLI, Nixpacks, and Templates\n\n - Craft resources that help grow the developer ecosystem and ensure that the experience for new and existing users is as seamless as possible\n\nAbout you\n\n - A strong ability to communicate clearly, whether it's via writing, video, or practical projects incorporating Railway\n\n - A enthusiast about our product, Railway uses Railway to build Railway. (Say that 5 times fast) You should be able to share insights with developers of all stripes to let them know how our product can help them\n\n - A great sense of direction and prioritization when it comes to dealing with the ambiguity of an early stage startup\n\n - Someone who is comfortable in a few different languages/stacks and can create educational content on how to deploy those projects on a public cloud (the status quo) or Railway (the thing we hope to be better than the status quo)\n\n - Able to take really technical concepts and make it as easy to understand as possible\n\nWe value and love to work with diverse persons from all backgrounds\n\nThings to Know\n\nFor better or worse, we're a startup; our team dynamics are different from companies of different sizes and stages.\n\n - We're distributed ALL across the globe, and that's only going to be more and more distributed. As a result, stuff is ALWAYS happening.\n\n - We do NOT expect you to work all the time, but you'll have to be diligent about your boundaries because the end of your day may overlap with the start of someone else's.\n\n - We're a small team, with high ownership, who are not only passionate about what we do, but seek to be exceptional as well. At the time of writing we're 21, serving hundreds of thousands of users. There's a lot of stuff going on, and a lot of ambiguity.\n\n - We want you to own it. We believe that ownership is a key to growth, and part of that growth is not only being able to make the choices, but owning the success, or failure, that comes with those choices.\n\nBenefits and Perks\n\nAt Railway, we provide best in class benefits. Great salary, full health benefits including dependents, strong equity grants, equipment stipend, and much more. For more details, check back on the main careers page https://railway.app/careers/developer-relations.\n\nBeyond compensation, there are a few things that we believe that make working at Railway truly unique:\n\n - Autonomy: We have very few meetings. Just a Monday and a Friday to go over the Company Board. We think your time is sacred, whether it's at work, or outside of work.\n\n - Ownership: We're a company with a high ownership, high autonomy culture. We hope that you'll come in, help us, and over the course of many years do the best work of your life. When we bring you onboard, we expect you to change the company.\n\n - Novel problems/solutions: We're a startup that's well funded, with cool problems, which lets us implement novel solutions! We abhor “busywork” and think, whether it's community, engineering, operations, etc there's always opportunity for creative and high leverage solutions.\n\n - Growth: We want you to grow with us, but we know that talent is loaned, so when you figure out what area you want to grow in next, whether it's at Railway or outside, we'll make sure you land there.\n\nHow We Hire\n\nNo tricks. No surprises. Here's the entire process.\n\n 1. Talk with us about the role\n    \n    - This is completely open ended and we're just trying to see who you are, what you want to do, and where you wanna go.\n\n 2. Work on a small project to discuss in the interview\n    \n    - Asynchronously implement the following:\n    \n    - Build something and deploy it on Railway using as many features as possible\n    \n    - You will submit your solution before the interview, and you'll sit down with a member of the team and go over the above. We'll poke into your solution, as well as get you acquainted with a member of the team.\n    \n    - You can, and SHOULD ask us questions ahead of time if you have them.\n\n 3. Review your solution with the Team\n    \n    - You'll sit down with someone on the team and go over the above. We'll poke into your solution, as well as get you acquainted with two more members of the team.\n    \n    - Looking for: Learn about your problem solving skills.

Meet the Team\n    \n    - You'll meet the Team, which will be comprised of 4 people from vastly different sections of the company.\n    \n    - Looking for: How you work with the rest of the team and communicate.\n\n 5.

      "job_description": "Supabase is the Postgres development platform, built by developers for developers. We provide a complete backend solution including Database, Auth, Storage, Edge Functions, Realtime, and Vector Search. All services are deeply integrated and designed for growth.\n\nWe’re seeking a Customer Solutions Architect (CSA) to help drive the adoption of Supabase across a diverse range of customers: from agile startups building towards their first launch to established brands with highly scaled workloads.\n\nAt Supabase, CSA’s are responsible for the entire customer journey, working closely with our most valuable users to:\n\n 1. Uncover and understand business and technical requirements.\n\n 2. Design and architect technical solutions built on the Supabase platform.\n\n 3. Work with customers to lead proof-of-value implementations.\n\n 4. Provide regular customer engagements to answer complex questions, unblock adoption, and optimize scaled performance.\n\nSuccessful CSAs always put customers first, working closely with them to become trusted advisors who understand their needs, work as an extension of their team toward common success, and advocate on behalf of the customer within Supabase.\n\nYou'll be joining our team to support Supabase Team & Enterprise customers, where you will be expected to lead and innovate around the following areas of responsibility:\n\n\nPRE-SALES DISCOVERY\n\n - Lead technical discovery to uncover business and technical objectives, set appropriate expectations of the Supabase platform, and define the criteria for success, ensuring customers can receive the guidance they need to achieve it.\n\n - Design, build, and present Supabase platform demonstrations to high-value customers.

Work closely with Support, Product, and Engineering to provide platform feedback, identify areas of improvement, while communicating platform roadmaps to customers.\n\n - Invest in customer connections to build a trust-based relationship. Everyday CSA’s work with the production data stores of startups and enterprises alike. Building trust in the Success team and Supabase platform is paramount to a successful customer relationship.\n\n\nPREFERRED EXPERIENCE\n\n - 6+ years of relevant work experience in Solutions Architecture, Database Engineering, or similar.\n\n - Strong background with relational database management systems such as PostgreSQL or MySQL.\n\n - Background in web application development, with familiarity with Python, C# and popular JavaScript frameworks (React, Vue, Svelte) as well as Node.js.\n\n - Very strong communication skills, particularly of technical concepts. CSA’s at Supabase spend a significant amount of time translating business needs to technical outcomes, and technical concepts to organizational impact.\n\n - Well-organized and effective storyteller with meaningful interpersonal skills. CSA’s often have to navigate multiple stakeholders with conflicting opinions, and the ability to effectively mediate this type of conflict is crucial.\n\n - Experience with project management, business analysis and revenue operations tools. We use HubSpot, BigQuery etc., and familiarity with these platforms will help enable your success.\n\n - Previous experience leading customer-facing engagements to deliver meaningful technical and business value.\n\n - \n\n\nWHAT WE OFFER\n\n - Fully Remote\n   \n   We hire globally. We believe you can do your best work from anywhere. There are no Supabase offices, but we provide a WeWork membership or co-working allowance you can use anywhere in the world.\n\n - ESOP\n   \n   Every team member receives ESOP (equity ownership) in the company. We want everyone to share in the upside of what we’re building together.\n\n - Tech Allowance\n   \n   Use this budget to set up your ideal work environment—laptop, monitor, headphones, or whatever helps you do your best work.\n\n - Health Benefits\n   \n   Supabase covers 100% of health insurance for employees and 80% for dependents, wherever you are. Your wellbeing and your family’s health are important to us.\n\n - Annual Off-Sites\n   \n   Once a year, the entire company gathers in a new city for a week of connection, collaboration, and fun. It’s a highlight of our year.\n\n - Flexible Work\n   \n   We operate asynchronously and trust you to manage your own time. You know what needs to be done and when.\n\n - Professional Development\n   \n   Every team member receives an annual education allowance to spend on learning—courses, books, conferences, or anything that supports your growth.\n\n\nABOUT THE TEAM\n\nSupabase was born-remote and open-source-first. We believe our globally distributed team is our secret weapon in building tools developers love.\n\n - 180+ team members\n\n - 40+ countries\n\n - 15+ languages spoken\n\n - $496M raised\n\n - 430,000+ community members\n\n - 30,000+ memes posted (and counting)\n\nWe move fast, build in public, and use what we ship. If it’s in your project, we probably use it in ours too. We believe deeply in the open-source ecosystem and strive to support—not replace—existing tools and communities.\n\n\nHIRING PROCESS\n\nWe keep things simple, async-friendly, and respectful of your time:\n\n 1. Apply – Our team will review your application.\n\n 2. Intro Call – A short video chat to get to know each other.\n\n 3. Interviews – Up to four calls with:\n    \n    - Founders\n    \n    - Future teammates\n    \n    - Someone cross-functional from product, growth, or engineering (depending on the role)\n\n 4.

CSA’s at Supabase spend a significant amount of time translating business needs to technical outcomes, and technical concepts to organizational impact.\n\n - Well-organized and effective storyteller with meaningful interpersonal skills. CSA’s often have to navigate multiple stakeholders with conflicting opinions, and the ability to effectively mediate this type of conflict is crucial.\n\n - Experience with project management, business analysis and revenue operations tools. We use HubSpot, BigQuery etc., and familiarity with these platforms will help enable your success.\n\n - Previous experience leading customer-facing engagements to deliver meaningful technical and business value.\n\n - \n\n\nWHAT WE OFFER\n\n - Fully Remote\n   \n   We hire globally. We believe you can do your best work from anywhere.

We want everyone to share in the upside of what we’re building together.\n\n - Tech Allowance\n   \n   Use this budget to set up your ideal work environment—laptop, monitor, headphones, or whatever helps you do your best work.\n\n - Health Benefits\n   \n   Supabase covers 100% of health insurance for employees and 80% for dependents, wherever you are. Your wellbeing and your family’s health are important to us.\n\n - Annual Off-Sites\n   \n   Once a year, the entire company gathers in a new city for a week of connection, collaboration, and fun. It’s a highlight of our year.\n\n - Flexible Work\n   \n   We operate asynchronously and trust you to manage your own time. You know what needs to be done and when.\n\n - Professional Development\n   \n   Every team member receives an annual education allowance to spend on learning—courses, books, conferences, or anything that supports your growth.\n\n\nABOUT THE TEAM\n\nSupabase was born-remote and open-source-first. We believe our globally distributed team is our secret weapon in building tools developers love.\n\n - 180+ team members\n\n - 40+ countries\n\n - 15+ languages spoken\n\n - $496M raised\n\n - 430,000+ community members\n\n - 30,000+ memes posted (and counting)\n\nWe move fast, build in public, and use what we ship. If it’s in your project, we probably use it in ours too. We believe deeply in the open-source ecosystem and strive to support—not replace—existing tools and communities.\n\n\nHIRING PROCESS\n\nWe keep things simple, async-friendly, and respectful of your time:\n\n 1. Apply – Our team will review your application.\n\n 2. Intro Call – A short video chat to get to know each other.\n\n 3. Interviews – Up to four calls with:\n    \n    - Founders\n    \n    - Future teammates\n    \n    - Someone cross-functional from product, growth, or engineering (depending on the role)\n\n 4.

      "job_description": "This is a remote position available anywhere in the world! Linkedin makes us show a country, but we hire the best people wherever they are.\n\nOur core mission at Railway is to make software engineers higher leverage. We believe that people should be given powerful tools so that they can spend less time setting up to do, and more time doing.\n\nBuilding the infrastructure which powers the Railway engine is the most core problem at Railway. As a infrastructure engineer, you will be directly responsible for exposing the knobs, bells, and whistles that allow the users to build to the wildest dreams. The tools you build will be instrumental in not only scaling internal operations, but scaling the company to infinite and beyond!\n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE\n\nFor this role, you will:\n\n - Build system-level software: our challenges aren't your usual kube-fits-all variety, so be prepared to build things from scratch based on first principles\n\n - Have a strong understanding or curiosity of OS level primitives - our business hinges on efficiency, so that means being masters of CPU, Memory, Network and the Kernel that wields it\n\n - Be a student of both distributed systems and simplicity - you know how to reach for the RAFT but you also know how far you can get with Postgres\n\n - Roll with the boring: build Golang/Rust GRPC services from scratch to expose your complex capabilities to the wider company in a scalable and performant manner\n\n - This is a high impact, high agency role with direct effect on company culture, trajectory, and outcome\n\n - You may be oncall from time to time in this role\n\n\nABOUT YOU\n\n - A strong understanding of distributed systems.

We think your time is sacred, whether it's at work, or outside of work.\n\n - Ownership: We're a company with a high ownership, high autonomy culture. We hope that you'll come in, help us, and over the course of many years do the best work of your life. When we bring you onboard, we expect you to change the company.\n\n - Novel problems/solutions: We're a startup that's well funded, with cool problems, which lets us implement novel solutions! We abhor “busywork” and think, whether it's community, engineering, operations, etc there's always opportunity for creative and high leverage solutions.\n\n - Growth: We want you to grow with us, but we know that talent is loaned, so when you figure out what area you want to grow in next, whether it's at Railway or outside, we'll make sure you land there.\n\nHow we hire\n\nNo tricks. No surprises. Here's the entire process:\n\n 1. Talk with us about the role\n    \n    - This is completely open ended and we're just trying to see who you are, what you want to do, and where you wanna go.\n\n 2. Work on a small project to discuss in the interview\n    \n    - Asynchronously implement the following:\n      \n      - Build an application to spin up and spin down a container using our GQL API. Please deploy on Railway before the interview and we will review the code during your interview. The app needs to have a UI component and not just a backend that uses the API.\n      \n      - You will submit your solution before the interview, and sit down with a member of the team and go over the above. We'll poke into your solution, as well as get you acquainted with a member of the team.\n      \n      - You can, and SHOULD! ask us questions ahead of time.\n\n 3. Review your solution with the Team\n    \n    1. You'll sit down with someone on the team and go over the above.

      "description": "This is a remote position available anywhere in the world! Linkedin makes us show a country, but we hire the best people wherever they are.\n\nOur core mission at Railway is to make software engineers higher leverage. We believe that people should be given powerful tools so that they can spend less time setting up to do, and more time doing.\n\nAt Railway, we believe that making tooling more accessible for build and deployment is one of the greatest possible productivity unlocks of our generation. We also believe that the major roadblock between us and our goal is strong interfacing paradigms.\n\nIf you’re looking to build an operating system for builders, we’d love to talk with you!\n\nCurious? Learn more in our blog post about this team and the great work they’re doing: Team Spotlight: Product Engineering (https://blog.railway.app/p/team-spotlight-product-engineering)\n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE\n\nFor this role, you will:\n\n - Build features end-to-end, from the UI in our dashboard to orchestrating workflows that interact with our microservices using Temporal.\n\n - Craft intuitive interfaces that allow our users to interface with powerful computing paradigms, with help from our design team.\n\n - Build TypeScript + GraphQL APIs with strong guarantees around modeling data, allowing both internal and external users to build against.\n\n - Write Engineering Requirement Documents to take something from idea, to defined tasks, to implementation, to monitoring it’s success.\n\n - Experience with, or at least the desire to learn Rust to contribute to our open-source repositories (CLI, Nixpacks https://nixpacks.com/docs, etc).\n\nSome projects full-stack engineers have worked on in the past\n\n - Rebuild logging infrastructure https://blog.railway.app/p/launch-week-01-observability to support 1B logs/day, from configuring ClickHouse to developing a brand new observability UI\n\n - Build Git for infrastructure https://blog.railway.app/p/launch-week-01-changesets and re-thinking how a project evolves over time\n\n - Build a tool for building user code into a deployable image using Nix packages. (github.com/railwayapp/nixpacks) http://github.com/railwayapp/nixpacks\n\n - Create interfaces to visualize project infrastructure on a 2D canvas https://community.railway.app/discuss/thread/service-groups-c1faed81\n\n - Add support for migrating deployments with a volume from one region to another using Temporal\n\n - Create a marketplace https://railway.app/templates for users to share re-usable pieces of infrastructure\n\nThis is a high impact, high agency role with direct effect on company culture, trajectory, and outcome.\n\n\nABOUT YOU\n\n - An ability to autonomously lead, design, and implement great product experiences, from front to back.\n\n - A strong understanding of frontend architecture to build interactivity-rich systems for fetching, mutating, and rendering data effectively\n\n - Experience managing complex asynchronous backend jobs for something like a build/deploy pipeline.\n\n - A desire to be a part of the entire project development process. From research gathering and planning, to implementation and monitoring\n\n - Great written and verbal communication skills for expressing ideas, designs, and potential solutions in mostly-asynchronous manner\n\nWe value and love to work with diverse persons from all backgrounds\n\nThings to know\n\nFor better or worse, we're a startup; our team dynamics are different from companies of different sizes and stages.\n\n - We're distributed ALL across the globe, and that's only going to be more and more distributed. As a result, stuff is ALWAYS happening.\n\n - We do NOT expect you to work all the time, but you'll have to be diligent about your boundaries because the end of your day may overlap with the start of someone else's.\n\n - We're a small team, with high ownership, who are not only passionate about what we do, but seek to be exceptional as well. At the time of writing we're 21, serving hundreds of thousands of users. There's a lot of stuff going on, and a lot of ambiguity.\n\n - We want you to own it. We believe that ownership is a key to growth, and part of that growth is not only being able to make the choices, but owning the success, or failure, that comes with those choices.\n\nBenefits and perks\n\nAt Railway, we provide best in class benefits. Great salary, full health benefits including dependents, strong equity grants, equipment stipend, and much more.
