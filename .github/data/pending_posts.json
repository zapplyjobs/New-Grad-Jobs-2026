      "job_description": "About Savvy Wealth: Wealth management is a $545 billion industry in the US, yet remains archaic and inefficient with low technology penetration. 75% of financial advisors don’t offer digital communication beyond email, and 62% still build financial plans manually in Excel. This leads to a poor client experience and results in financial advisors spending over 70% of their time on non-client facing, manual work. Savvy is changing that. We’re building the most advisor-centric platform in wealth management: a digital-first solution that modernizes human financial advice. Advisors who partner with Savvy tap into AI-powered software, automated sales and marketing, and seamless back office workflows to scale faster and spend more time with clients. We’ve raised over $105M to date from Thrive Capital, Index Ventures, Canvas Ventures, Mark Casady (former LPL Financial CEO), and other top-tier investors. Our team is made up of repeat founders and operators who’ve helped build Airbnb, Square, Brex, Carta, Facebook, $200B+ RIAs, and more. Savvy is at a pivotal point in its growth trajectory, having established strong product-market fit in providing a modern platform to financial advisors.
