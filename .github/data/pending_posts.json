How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate.

We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day.

At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles.

However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

You’ll write a significant amount of production code, set the quality bar, and shape how agentic systems integrate with Brex’s core workflows.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a deeply product-driven role. Success is measured by better outcomes for customers — higher-quality expense documentation, stronger policy compliance, and less time spent clicking around Brex.com — not by novelty or research output.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where you’ll work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This role will be based in our Seattle office. We are a hybrid environment that combines the energy and connections of being in the office with the benefits and flexibility of working from home.

We help companies spend with confidence with integrated corporate cards, banking, and global payments, plus intuitive software for travel and expenses. Tens of thousands of companies from startups to enterprises — including DoorDash, Flexport, and Compass — use Brex to proactively control spend, reduce costs, and increase efficiency on a global scale.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Working at Brex allows you to push your limits, challenge the status quo, and collaborate with some of the brightest minds in the industry. We’re committed to building a diverse team and inclusive culture and believe your potential should only be limited by how big you can dream. We make this a reality by empowering you with the tools, resources, and support you need to grow your career.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Marketing at Brex&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Marketing team tells the Brex story, determines messaging and positioning, and translates our products and features into tangible customer benefits.

You genuinely love startups and follow the ecosystem closely.

At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco.

We encourage you to apply even if you might need some flexibility for an interim period of time for relocation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deadline to apply: &lt;/strong&gt;None.

However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day.

At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

Figma’s platform helps teams bring ideas to life—whether you&#39;re brainstorming, creating a prototype, translating designs into code, or iterating with AI. From idea to product, Figma empowers teams to streamline workflows, move faster, and work together in real time from anywhere in the world.

Over the past year, Figma has shifted from teams independently building bespoke, React-based admin tools to a model where dozens of engineering teams build on a shared internal platform that enforces security, privacy, and access controls by default.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As an Engineering Manager on Internal Tools, you’ll lead a team of senior engineers working at the intersection of engineering, operations, and platform strategy. You’ll partner closely with CX (Product Support), Legal, and Program Management to translate shared goals into durable, scalable solutions. While this team works on engineering workflows, the focus is on workflows that operate within the context of Figma’s product and customer environments—enabling teams to support, administer, and debug real customer scenarios—rather than tooling for the software development lifecycle itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This role is ideal for someone who enjoys operating in ambiguous, cross-functional spaces, amplifying the impact of strong ICs, and driving outcomes through platform leverage.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a full time role that can be held from one of our US hubs or remotely in the United States.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you&#39;ll do at Figma:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Lead and support a team of senior engineers building internal platforms and workflows used across Figma&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Provide clear ownership and continuity for complex, cross-functional initiatives that span Product Support, Legal, Program Management, and Engineering&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Reduce cross-organizational coordination overhead so engineers can focus on high-leverage technical work&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Partner deeply with CX (Product Support) to understand desired outcomes and translate them into scalable platform capabilities&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ensure security, privacy, reliability, and operational safety are treated as non-negotiable in all work&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Balance short-term partner needs with long-term platform leverage and sustainability&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Bring clarity and structure to ambiguous problem spaces while maintaining strong delivery discipline&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’d love to hear from you if you have:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience managing senior, high-performing software engineers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A track record of leading complex, cross-functional initiatives without dedicated PM or TPM support&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Strong judgment around prioritization, tradeoffs, and long-term technical sustainability&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience partnering closely with operational teams such as Product Support, Trust &amp;amp; Safety, Legal, or similar&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The ability to lead through influence, build trust with stakeholders, and challenge problem framing constructively&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While it’s not required, it’s an added plus if you also have:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience stewarding shared internal platforms with many downstream consumers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with security- or privacy-sensitive systems and workflows&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience operating in environments with high ambiguity and evolving requirements&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A background in platform, infrastructure, or internal tooling teams&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;section page-centered&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;section page-centered&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;At Figma, one of our values is Grow as you go.

Over the past year, Figma has shifted from teams independently building bespoke, React-based admin tools to a model where dozens of engineering teams build on a shared internal platform that enforces security, privacy, and access controls by default.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As an Engineering Manager on Internal Tools, you’ll lead a team of senior engineers working at the intersection of engineering, operations, and platform strategy. You’ll partner closely with CX (Product Support), Legal, and Program Management to translate shared goals into durable, scalable solutions. While this team works on engineering workflows, the focus is on workflows that operate within the context of Figma’s product and customer environments—enabling teams to support, administer, and debug real customer scenarios—rather than tooling for the software development lifecycle itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This role is ideal for someone who enjoys operating in ambiguous, cross-functional spaces, amplifying the impact of strong ICs, and driving outcomes through platform leverage.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a full time role that can be held from one of our US hubs or remotely in the United States.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you&#39;ll do at Figma:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Lead and support a team of senior engineers building internal platforms and workflows used across Figma&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Provide clear ownership and continuity for complex, cross-functional initiatives that span Product Support, Legal, Program Management, and Engineering&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Reduce cross-organizational coordination overhead so engineers can focus on high-leverage technical work&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Partner deeply with CX (Product Support) to understand desired outcomes and translate them into scalable platform capabilities&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ensure security, privacy, reliability, and operational safety are treated as non-negotiable in all work&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Balance short-term partner needs with long-term platform leverage and sustainability&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Bring clarity and structure to ambiguous problem spaces while maintaining strong delivery discipline&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’d love to hear from you if you have:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience managing senior, high-performing software engineers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A track record of leading complex, cross-functional initiatives without dedicated PM or TPM support&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Strong judgment around prioritization, tradeoffs, and long-term technical sustainability&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience partnering closely with operational teams such as Product Support, Trust &amp;amp; Safety, Legal, or similar&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The ability to lead through influence, build trust with stakeholders, and challenge problem framing constructively&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While it’s not required, it’s an added plus if you also have:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience stewarding shared internal platforms with many downstream consumers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with security- or privacy-sensitive systems and workflows&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience operating in environments with high ambiguity and evolving requirements&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A background in platform, infrastructure, or internal tooling teams&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;section page-centered&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;section page-centered&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;At Figma, one of our values is Grow as you go.

We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day.

At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco.

Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day.

At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

As usage of our AI services grows, we need to ensure they are not misused. The Safeguards team is at the forefront of protecting our users from the risks of powerful AIs as well as ethical, technical, and social risks from the use of generative AI. The Safeguards team at Anthropic builds protections for new AI features enabled by the research teams and protects new products and surfaces developed by our product teams. As a Product Manager for the Safeguards team at Anthropic, you will own the ideation, design, development and deployment of Safeguards systems and relevant product UX to ensure we are advancing frontier models safely to users across various cloud platforms. You will work closely with our research and product teams to develop detections, evals, interventions, and tools to measure and mitigate deployment and user risks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are looking for a product manager who is deeply committed to making AI safe and beneficial for humanity.&amp;nbsp; You are aware of the risks and are committed to working with experts and coming up with ideas for Anthropic to implement. You have deep technical expertise in development, deployment and measurement of Safeguards systems. You thrive in rapidly moving and ambiguous environments.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Responsibilities:&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Determine how to build in safety by design upstream and leverage downstream defenses for Anthropic’s frontier models, AI products, customers on different surfaces - Claude.ai, 1P API, external Cloud providers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ability to write safety evals and communicate externally about safety.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Drive impact via ruthless prioritization by clearly defining problems, solution options forward, clarity on both business &amp;amp; technical tradeoffs and accordingly clear requirements toward MVP vs. ideal state.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Align &amp;amp; collaborate with policy, enforcement, research, engineering and cross functional stakeholders.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Understand the AI landscape and ecosystem to plan for mitigation of deployment risks of increasingly powerful models and determined adversaries.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Lead the development of metrics to understand the area, performance, blindspots to help inform future project planning.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;You may be a good fit if you have:&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;5+ years in product management with a focus on fast problem understanding, building roadmaps with tractable progress, ability to get into the details on data, detection &amp;amp; interventions, infrastructure &amp;amp; tools, and/or evals.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ability to make technical tradeoff decisions; ideally with experience working across policy experts, AI/ML research engineers and software engineering teams to design and build state of the art safety systems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Strong user understanding of how our products are used, their Safeguards concerns and how we provide the best solutions.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Demonstrated ability to build product and engineering strategy across multiple cross-functional teams for a rapidly changing space.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Demonstrated experience in designing and building metrics to evaluate risks, system performance, user impact and making crisp tradeoffs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Very strong ability to navigate, and prioritize amidst rapidly changing product specs, and to flex into different domains to bring clarity and execute.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Evidence of exercising judgment and decision making in ambiguous situations.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Planning, building, launching and measuring new products / systems in a zero to one environment.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ability to clearly articulate complex technical concepts to non-technical audiences in written and verbal communication.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Think creatively about the risks and benefits of new technologies, and think beyond past checklists and playbooks.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The annual compensation range for this role is listed below.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (&quot;OTE&quot;) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Annual Salary:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-range&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$305,000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;divider&quot;&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;$385,000 USD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logistics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education requirements: &lt;/strong&gt;We require at least a Bachelor&#39;s degree in a related field or equivalent experience.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Location-based hybrid policy:&lt;/strong&gt; Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day.

At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research.

At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco.

We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day.

At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco.

Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

Our Forward Deployed Engineers embed directly with strategic customers to ship production AI applications that solve real business problems. As this practice grows, we need a founding leader to build and scale it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=&quot;p5&quot;&gt;As the first FDE Manager, you&#39;ll own the team that sits at the frontier of enterprise AI deployment. You&#39;ll hire and develop a high-performing team of FDEs, set the technical and operational bar for customer engagements, and build the playbooks that turn one-off successes into repeatable patterns. You&#39;ll work hand-in-hand with Engagement Managers who own delivery logistics and stakeholder management, while you ensure your team is shipping quality code, growing technically, and representing Anthropic at the highest level in customer environments.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=&quot;p5&quot;&gt;This is a player-coach role with a strong bias toward leadership. You&#39;ll stay close enough to the technical work to review architectures, debug production issues, and pair with your team when it matters — but your primary impact will come from the people you hire, the standards you set, and the culture you create. You&#39;ll partner cross-functionally with Sales, Product, and Engineering to shape how Anthropic serves its most strategic customers, and your team&#39;s field insights will directly influence product direction.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=&quot;p5&quot;&gt;This role requires someone who thrives in ambiguity and is energized by building from zero to one.

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Anthropic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=&quot;p5&quot;&gt;Anthropic&#39;s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=&quot;p5&quot;&gt;Anthropic is building the Applied AI team to help the world&#39;s most ambitious organizations adopt Claude in ways that are transformative, safe, and lasting. Our Forward Deployed Engineers embed directly with strategic customers to ship production AI applications that solve real business problems. As this practice grows, we need a founding leader to build and scale it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=&quot;p5&quot;&gt;As the first FDE Manager, you&#39;ll own the team that sits at the frontier of enterprise AI deployment. You&#39;ll hire and develop a high-performing team of FDEs, set the technical and operational bar for customer engagements, and build the playbooks that turn one-off successes into repeatable patterns. You&#39;ll work hand-in-hand with Engagement Managers who own delivery logistics and stakeholder management, while you ensure your team is shipping quality code, growing technically, and representing Anthropic at the highest level in customer environments.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=&quot;p5&quot;&gt;This is a player-coach role with a strong bias toward leadership. You&#39;ll stay close enough to the technical work to review architectures, debug production issues, and pair with your team when it matters — but your primary impact will come from the people you hire, the standards you set, and the culture you create. You&#39;ll partner cross-functionally with Sales, Product, and Engineering to shape how Anthropic serves its most strategic customers, and your team&#39;s field insights will directly influence product direction.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=&quot;p5&quot;&gt;This role requires someone who thrives in ambiguity and is energized by building from zero to one.

      "job_description": "&lt;div class=&quot;content-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discord is used by over 200 million people every month for many different reasons, but there’s one thing that nearly everyone does on our platform:&lt;strong&gt; play video games.&lt;/strong&gt; Over 90% of our users play games, spending a combined 1.5 billion hours playing thousands of unique titles on Discord each month. Discord plays a uniquely important role in the future of gaming. We are focused on making it easier and more fun for people to talk and hang out before, during, and after playing games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Discord Creative Systems Team is seeking a versatile systems illustrator with strong technical craft and conceptual ideation skills. The ideal candidate combines illustration expertise with systematic thinking and precision in designing for product environments. You&#39;ll enhance the user experience by creating cohesive iconography, illustrations, and abstracted UI graphics that bring consistency and delight to Discord&#39;s visual language. We&#39;re looking for someone who can independently craft thoughtful graphics, establish and document design guidelines, and collaborate with cross-functional teams to align creative work with product goals.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our work on Creative Systems focuses on designing scalable creative solutions and maintaining the system that defines how graphics are used and experienced on Discord. This includes developing icons, illustrations and abstracted UI that communicate features clearly, collaborating with animators, and codifying guidelines that ensure consistency while allowing for creative evolution.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a Systems Illustrator on Creative Systems, you&#39;ll develop graphic solutions that strengthen product communication across web, desktop, and mobile platforms.

      "job_description": "&lt;div class=&quot;content-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Anthropic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Cloud Inference team scales and optimizes Claude to serve the massive audiences of developers and enterprise companies across AWS, GCP, Azure, and future cloud service providers (CSPs). We own the end-to-end product of Claude on each cloud platform—from API integration and intelligent request routing to inference execution, capacity management, and day-to-day operations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our engineers are extremely high leverage: we simultaneously drive multiple major revenue streams while optimizing one of Anthropic&#39;s most precious resources—compute. As we expand to more cloud platforms, the complexity of managing inference efficiently across providers with different hardware, networking stacks, and operational models grows significantly. We need engineers who can navigate these platform differences, build robust abstractions that work across providers, and make smart infrastructure decisions that keep us cost-effective at massive scale.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Your work will increase the scale at which our services operate, accelerate our ability to reliably launch new frontier models and innovative features to customers across all platforms, and ensure our LLMs meet rigorous safety, performance, and security standards.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What You&#39;ll Do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Design and build infrastructure that serves Claude across multiple CSPs, accounting for differences in compute hardware, networking, APIs, and operational models&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Collaborate with CSP partner engineering teams to resolve operational issues, influence provider roadmaps, and stand up end-to-end serving on new cloud platforms&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Design and evolve CI/CD automation systems, including validation and deployment pipelines, that reliably ship new model versions to millions of users across cloud platforms without regressions&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Design interfaces and tooling abstractions across CSPs that enable cost-effective inference management, scale across providers, and reduce per-platform complexity&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Contribute to capacity planning and autoscaling strategies that dynamically match supply with demand across CSP validation and production workloads&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Optimize inference cost and performance across providers—designing workload placement and routing systems that direct requests to the most cost-effective accelerator and region&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Contribute to inference features that must work consistently across all platforms&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Analyze observability data across providers to identify performance bottlenecks, cost anomalies, and regressions, and drive remediation based on real-world production workloads&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You May Be a Good Fit If You:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have significant software engineering experience, with a strong background in high-performance, large-scale distributed systems serving millions of users&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have experience building or operating services on at least one major cloud platform (AWS, GCP, or Azure), with exposure to Kubernetes, Infrastructure as Code or container orchestration&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have strong interest in inference&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Thrive in cross-functional collaboration with both internal teams and external partners&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are a fast learner who can quickly ramp up on new technologies, hardware platforms, and provider ecosystems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are highly autonomous and self-driven, taking ownership of problems end-to-end with a bias toward flexibility and high-impact work&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Pick up slack, even when it goes outside your job description&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong Candidates May Also Have Experience With&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Direct experience working with CSP partner teams to scale infrastructure or products across multiple platforms, navigating differences in networking, security, privacy, billing, and managed service offerings&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A background in building platform-agnostic tooling or abstraction layers that work across cloud providers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Hands-on experience with capacity management, cost optimization, or resource planning at scale across heterogeneous environments&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Strong familiarity with LLM inference optimization, batching, caching, and serving strategies&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience with Machine learning infrastructure including GPUs, TPUs, Trainium, or other AI accelerators&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Background designing and building CI/CD systems that automate deployment and validation across cloud environments&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Solid understanding of multi-region deployments, geographic routing, and global traffic management&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Proficiency in Python or

degree in a related field or equivalent experience.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Location-based hybrid policy:&lt;/strong&gt; Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Safeguards Engineering builds and operates the infrastructure that keeps Anthropic&#39;s AI systems safe in production — the classifiers, detection pipelines, evaluation platforms, and monitoring systems that sit between our models and the real world. That infrastructure needs to be not just correct, but &lt;em&gt;reliable&lt;/em&gt;: when a safety-critical pipeline goes down or degrades, the consequences can be serious, and they can be invisible until someone looks closely.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a Technical Program Manager for Safeguards Infrastructure and Evals, you&#39;ll own the operational health and forward momentum of this stack. Your primary responsibility is driving reliability — owning the incident-response and post-mortem process, ensuring SLOs are defined and met in partnership with various teams, and making sure that when things go wrong, the right people know, the right actions get taken, and those actions actually get closed out. Alongside that ongoing operational rhythm, you&#39;ll coordinate the larger platform investments: migrations, eval-platform improvements, and the cross-team dependencies that connect them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This role sits at the intersection of operations and program management. It requires genuine technical depth — you need to understand how these systems work well enough to triage effectively, judge what&#39;s actually safety-critical versus what can wait, and have informed conversations with the engineers building and maintaining them. But the core of the job is keeping the machine running well and the work moving.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What You&#39;ll Do:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Own the Safeguards Engineering ops review - &lt;/strong&gt;Drive the recurring cadence that keeps the team informed and coordinated: surfacing recent incidents and failures, bringing visibility to reliability trends, and making sure the right people are in the room when decisions need to be made. This is the heartbeat of how Safeguards Eng stays ahead of operational risk.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drive incident tracking and post-mortem execution - &lt;/strong&gt;When incidents happen — and in this space, they happen regularly — you&#39;ll make sure they get followed through properly. That means tracking incidents across the organization (including those owned by partner teams like Inference), ensuring post-mortems get written, and most critically, making sure the action items that come out of them actually get done. Closing the loop on post-mortem actions is one of the highest-leverage things this role does.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish and maintain SLOs with partner teams - &lt;/strong&gt;Work with Safeguards Engineering teams and key partners — particularly Inference and Cloud Inference — to define service-level objectives for safety-critical pipelines. Then build the tracking and reporting that makes it possible to tell whether those SLOs are being met, and surface it when they&#39;re not.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintain runbook quality and incident-ownership clarity - &lt;/strong&gt;Safety-critical systems need clear playbooks for when things go wrong. Partner with engineering leads to keep runbooks accurate, actionable, and up to date — and ensure that ownership of incidents (including for areas like account-banning false positives and CSAM detection) is unambiguous so that nothing falls through the cracks during an active incident.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drive platform migrations and infrastructure projects - &lt;/strong&gt;Own the program management for the larger infrastructure work on the roadmap: migrating the infra from one platform to the next, moving from one incident platform to the next and from one cloud system monitoring to another, and other migrations as they come. These are cross-team efforts with real dependencies — your job is to keep them sequenced, on track, and connected to the teams that need them.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coordinate evals platform improvements - &lt;/strong&gt;Partner with the evals engineering team to drive improvements to the evaluation platform — including self-serve capabilities and the broader eval factory infrastructure. Help scope the work, track dependencies on other Safeguards systems, and make sure the evals platform is keeping pace with the team&#39;s needs.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You might be a good fit if you:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have solid technical program management experience, particularly in operational or infrastructure-heavy environments — you&#39;re comfortable owning a mix of ongoing operational cadences and discrete project work simultaneously.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Understand how production ML systems work well enough to triage incidents intelligently and have substantive conversations with engineers about what&#39;s going wrong and why — you don&#39;t need to write the code, but you need to follow the technical thread.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are energized by closing loops. Post-mortem action items that never get done, SLOs that no one checks, runbooks that go stale — these things bother you, and you know how to build the processes and follow-ups that fix them.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Can work effectively across team boundaries — comfortable coordinating with partner teams (like Inference) where you don&#39;t have direct authority, and skilled at keeping shared work moving through influence and clear communication.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Thrive in environments where the work shifts between &quot;keep the lights on&quot; and &quot;build something new&quot; — and can context-switch between incident follow-ups and longer-horizon platform projects without dropping either.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have experience with or strong interest in AI safety — you understand why the reliability of a safety-critical pipeline is a different kind of problem than the reliability of a product feature, and that distinction motivates you.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong candidates may also:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have experience with SRE practices, incident management frameworks, or on-call operations at scale.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have worked on or with evaluation infrastructure for ML systems — understanding how evals get designed, run, and interpreted.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have experience driving infrastructure migrations in complex, multi-team environments — particularly where the migration touches operational systems that can&#39;t go offline.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Be familiar with monitoring and alerting tooling (PagerDuty, Datadog, or equivalents) and the operational culture around them.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deadline to apply:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;None, applications will be received on a rolling basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The annual compensation range for this role is listed below.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (&quot;OTE&quot;) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Annual Salary:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-range&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$290,000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;divider&quot;&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;$365,000 USD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logistics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education requirements: &lt;/strong&gt;We require at least a Bachelor&#39;s degree in a related field or equivalent experience.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Location-based hybrid policy:&lt;/strong&gt; Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time.

      "description": "&lt;div class=&quot;content-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discord is used by over 200 million people every month for many different reasons, but there’s one thing that nearly everyone does on our platform:&lt;strong&gt; play video games.&lt;/strong&gt; Over 90% of our users play games, spending a combined 1.5 billion hours playing thousands of unique titles on Discord each month. Discord plays a uniquely important role in the future of gaming. We are focused on making it easier and more fun for people to talk and hang out before, during, and after playing games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our Web Platform team is responsible for building and maintaining the critical systems that power Discord&#39;s frontend development across web, desktop, and mobile platforms. These systems support hundreds of engineers daily, process thousands of builds and deployments, and enable rapid feature delivery through robust tooling infrastructure. Through developing and operating foundational JavaScript build systems - including linters, bundlers, package managers, and CI/CD automation - our work allows internal developers to ship features quickly and safely while ensuring optimal performance, correctness, and developer ergonomics. This team also owns the localization and translation systems that power the strings and copy found across all of our apps and platforms.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a Senior Software Engineer on this team, you will continuously improve our build tooling, developer workflows, and infrastructure - affecting the productivity of every frontend engineer at Discord and ultimately every user interaction on the platform!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What You&#39;ll Be Doing:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Building and maintaining the tools, pipelines, and processes that keep frontend development at Discord fast, safe, and reliable.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Becoming an expert in JavaScript tooling and serving as a resource to help teams solve any and all problems they encounter during development.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Refactoring and upgrading the codebase to pay down tech debt, keep up with the state of the art in web development, and drive progress toward better maintainability.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Writing new and unique tools based on the specific needs of Discord’s frontend projects to make everything Just Work.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Digging deep into bundlers, linters, formatters, editor plugins, and more to optimize their performance, adopt and test new features early on, and continuously improve the experience for the developers using them.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you have:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;3+ years of working with JavaScript tools and the Node.js ecosystem.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with and a desire to work across multiple programming languages (generally including JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Rust, Kotlin, Go, and Swift).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience developing and maintaining CLI tools and packages in JavaScript.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A strong sense for writing maintainable code and deliberately documenting for the future.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Understanding of all of the tools involved in frontend development and how they work together.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus Points:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Familiarity and experience with localization in frontend applications.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with React Native, related tools (Metro, Hermes), and bridging between JavaScript and native code.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience with directly maintaining or writing plugins for tools like bundlers, linters, or formatters in any language.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience with CI/CD orchestration, Cloudflare workers, cloud storage providers, and other application deployment processes.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Candidates must reside in or be willing to relocate to the San Francisco Bay Area (Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, Napa, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Solano, and Sonoma counties).

This role focuses on enabling users to &lt;em&gt;find, explore, and act&lt;/em&gt; on observability and security data using AI-powered semantic understanding rather than rigid query syntax or navigation paths.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As Datadog continues to expand in breadth and depth, discovering the right data, services, insights, or actions becomes increasingly complex. Semantic search and intent understanding are foundational capabilities that power natural language queries (NLQ), AI-driven navigation, recommendations, and agentic search experiences where systems iteratively refine queries, invoke tools, and adapt based on intermediate results.

Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

Figma’s platform helps teams bring ideas to life—whether you&#39;re brainstorming, creating a prototype, translating designs into code, or iterating with AI. From idea to product, Figma empowers teams to streamline workflows, move faster, and work together in real time from anywhere in the world. If you&#39;re excited to shape the future of design and collaboration, join us!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Design systems are one of&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;the core features of Figma’s creative editing tools, letting our users repeatedly use strong design foundations.

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;About the Role:&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is seeking an Education Platform Engineering Lead to help build the technical foundation for how Anthropic educates customers and enterprises at scale, and to shape what that even means when AI is the delivery mechanism, not just the subject being taught.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Your work will define how millions of people experience learning about Claude: how content is served and adapted in real time, how assessments respond to what a learner actually understands, how credentialing systems verify genuine competence rather than course completion, and how the entire platform evolves as fast as the product it teaches. You&#39;ll build the infrastructure that makes AI-native education real — not as a concept, but as a working system that people interact with every day.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You’ll own the technical vision for our AI-driven educational experience: the platform layer, enterprise readiness features, the data architecture, the AI-augmented pipelines, the integrations, and the delivery systems. You&#39;ll work with a handful of highly technical educational collaborators to own the technical vision and execution for how Anthropic’s education team delivers educational experiences at scale, and you&#39;ll build the AI-augmented pipelines and platform capabilities that let a small team of educators operate with reach and responsiveness that would otherwise require an organization ten times larger.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is an engineering role for someone who genuinely cares about how people learn. You&#39;ll make platform decisions that are deeply educational, and you need the judgment to make those decisions well, not just implement someone else&#39;s spec. You&#39;ll interface closely with Anthropic&#39;s security, infrastructure, and data teams, and you&#39;ll partner with trainers and educators on the GTM, devrel, and education teams who will be your primary stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Anthropic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is an AI safety and research company that&#39;s working to build reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems.

You’ll determine what to build, what to extend, and what to replace as needs evolve&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Build AI-augmented pipelines for content generation, real-time adaptation, assessment delivery, and quality assurance — working closely with the education team to understand what these systems need to do pedagogically&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Design platform capabilities that enable genuinely new kinds of empowering learning experiences — adaptive paths, competency-based progression, AI-evaluated demonstrations of skill — not just digital versions of traditional courses&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Interface with Anthropic&#39;s security, infrastructure, and data teams to ensure education systems meet organizational standards and integrate cleanly with existing architecture&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Build platform abstractions that let non-engineers on the team configure, extend, and experiment with educational experiences without engineering bottlenecks&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Make product-level decisions about how the platform works — you&#39;re shaping what the learning experience is, not just serving it&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You may be a good fit if you have:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;7+ years of software engineering experience, with demonstrated ability to take a platform from zero to production at scale&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Genuine passion for education — you think about how people learn, you have opinions about what educational technology should look like in an AI-native world, and you want to build it&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A strong eye for quality educational content, with a sense of the complex systems that produce it&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Full-stack engineering skills with particular strength in backend systems: databases, APIs, authentication, reliability, and infrastructure&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Experience building and operating platforms that serve many concurrent users reliably&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Comfort with ambiguity and ownership: you&#39;ll need to translate pedagogical intent into technical architecture without heavy specification&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Experience interfacing with security and infrastructure teams to meet organizational requirements while maintaining development velocity&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A working practice of using AI tools in your own engineering workflows — and genuine curiosity about how AI fundamentally changes what educational platforms can be&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong candidates may also have:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Experience building or significantly contributing to learning platforms, credentialing systems, or educational technology products&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Background in or exposure to learning science, instructional design, or educational research&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Experience with SSO/identity (SAML, OAuth), badging standards (Open Badges), or LTI integrations&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Familiarity with building systems that incorporate LLM capabilities as core infrastructure&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Prior work at a high-growth company where you built platform infrastructure that other teams depended on&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Experience designing systems that non-technical users configure and operate&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The annual compensation range for this role is listed below.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (&quot;OTE&quot;) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Annual Salary:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-range&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$300,000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;divider&quot;&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;$405,000 USD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logistics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education requirements: &lt;/strong&gt;We require at least a Bachelor&#39;s degree in a related field or equivalent experience.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Location-based hybrid policy:&lt;/strong&gt; Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

      "description": "&lt;div class=&quot;content-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Anthropic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;About the Role:&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is seeking an Education Platform Engineering Lead to help build the technical foundation for how Anthropic educates customers and enterprises at scale, and to shape what that even means when AI is the delivery mechanism, not just the subject being taught.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Your work will define how millions of people experience learning about Claude: how content is served and adapted in real time, how assessments respond to what a learner actually understands, how credentialing systems verify genuine competence rather than course completion, and how the entire platform evolves as fast as the product it teaches. You&#39;ll build the infrastructure that makes AI-native education real — not as a concept, but as a working system that people interact with every day.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You’ll own the technical vision for our AI-driven educational experience: the platform layer, enterprise readiness features, the data architecture, the AI-augmented pipelines, the integrations, and the delivery systems. You&#39;ll work with a handful of highly technical educational collaborators to own the technical vision and execution for how Anthropic’s education team delivers educational experiences at scale, and you&#39;ll build the AI-augmented pipelines and platform capabilities that let a small team of educators operate with reach and responsiveness that would otherwise require an organization ten times larger.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is an engineering role for someone who genuinely cares about how people learn. You&#39;ll make platform decisions that are deeply educational, and you need the judgment to make those decisions well, not just implement someone else&#39;s spec. You&#39;ll interface closely with Anthropic&#39;s security, infrastructure, and data teams, and you&#39;ll partner with trainers and educators on the GTM, devrel, and education teams who will be your primary stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Anthropic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is an AI safety and research company that&#39;s working to build reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our customers and for society as a whole. Our interdisciplinary team has experience across ML, physics, policy, business and product.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Architect and own Anthropic’s enterprise ready education platform and infrastructure — authentication/SSO, learner data models, content delivery, credentialing, and progress tracking — designed for scale, AI-forward features, and reliability from day one&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Own the technical vision for how Anthropic delivers AI-driven educational experiences and shaping what&#39;s possible, not just building what&#39;s requested. You’ll determine what to build, what to extend, and what to replace as needs evolve&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Build AI-augmented pipelines for content generation, real-time adaptation, assessment delivery, and quality assurance — working closely with the education team to understand what these systems need to do pedagogically&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Design platform capabilities that enable genuinely new kinds of empowering learning experiences — adaptive paths, competency-based progression, AI-evaluated demonstrations of skill — not just digital versions of traditional courses&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Interface with Anthropic&#39;s security, infrastructure, and data teams to ensure education systems meet organizational standards and integrate cleanly with existing architecture&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Build platform abstractions that let non-engineers on the team configure, extend, and experiment with educational experiences without engineering bottlenecks&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Make product-level decisions about how the platform works — you&#39;re shaping what the learning experience is, not just serving it&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You may be a good fit if you have:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;7+ years of software engineering experience, with demonstrated ability to take a platform from zero to production at scale&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Genuine passion for education — you think about how people learn, you have opinions about what educational technology should look like in an AI-native world, and you want to build it&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A strong eye for quality educational content, with a sense of the complex systems that produce it&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Full-stack engineering skills with particular strength in backend systems: databases, APIs, authentication, reliability, and infrastructure&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Experience building and operating platforms that serve many concurrent users reliably&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Comfort with ambiguity and ownership: you&#39;ll need to translate pedagogical intent into technical architecture without heavy specification&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Experience interfacing with security and infrastructure teams to meet organizational requirements while maintaining development velocity&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A working practice of using AI tools in your own engineering workflows — and genuine curiosity about how AI fundamentally changes what educational platforms can be&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong candidates may also have:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Experience building or significantly contributing to learning platforms, credentialing systems, or educational technology products&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Background in or exposure to learning science, instructional design, or educational research&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Experience with SSO/identity (SAML, OAuth), badging standards (Open Badges), or LTI integrations&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Familiarity with building systems that incorporate LLM capabilities as core infrastructure&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Prior work at a high-growth company where you built platform infrastructure that other teams depended on&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Experience designing systems that non-technical users configure and operate&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The annual compensation range for this role is listed below.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (&quot;OTE&quot;) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Annual Salary:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-range&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$300,000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;divider&quot;&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;$405,000 USD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logistics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education requirements: &lt;/strong&gt;We require at least a Bachelor&#39;s degree in a related field or equivalent experience.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Location-based hybrid policy:&lt;/strong&gt; Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic’s Compute and Infrastructure organizations are responsible for the systems that train our models, serve our products, and support our engineering teams. That includes datacenter operations, capacity planning across cloud providers and our own facilities, accelerator cluster management, production serving infrastructure, developer tooling, data pipelines, and networking. It’s a lot of surface area, and the demands on it are growing fast.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We’re hiring a TPM leader to own program management across this whole ecosystem from compute supply through to production workloads. Today, there are a few TPMs working in these areas but no dedicated TPM team, and you will build it. We’re bringing up new datacenters, scaling multi-cloud compute across AWS, GCP, and Azure, managing datacenter construction, and building the software infrastructure to keep pace. The team is currently small but expected to grow very quickly, and we’re looking for a senior leader with experience at scale to build and scale this team to support Anthropic’s rapid growth. You’ll report to the Head of TPM, partnering closely with various engineering leaders on technical strategy, roadmapping, and aligning TPM support where it is most impactful.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Expect to spend most of your time as an IC at the start. You’ll personally drive 2–3 critical programs while hiring your team in parallel. As the team grows, you’ll shift more toward people leadership, but this is a role where you need to be comfortable doing the work yourself before you can hand it off.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you&#39;ll do:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;h3 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IC Program Leadership (Near-term Focus)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Own and drive 2–3 of the highest-priority programs across compute and infrastructure while you build the team&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Run the actual programs—datacenter bring-up timelines, capacity scaling plans, infrastructure migrations, cross-team reliability efforts, or whatever the most pressing needs are&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build the processes and playbooks as you go—figure out what works by doing it, then codify it for the team&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Earn credibility with engineering leads through solid execution, not just strategy&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Team Building &amp;amp; Development&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build a TPM team largely from scratch: define roles, write JDs, source candidates, close hires&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Set the standard for what good TPM work looks like in this domain through your own output&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Coach and develop TPMs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Transition programs to your team as you hire&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Planning &amp;amp; Prioritization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Work with various engineering leads to identify work that would most benefit from TPM support&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Make real tradeoffs about what to staff vs. what to skip given limited TPM capacity during the build phase&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Maintain portfolio-level visibility across programs—status, risks, dependencies, blockers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Represent the team in planning cycles and leadership reviews&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cross-functional Coordination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Coordinate across Compute, Infrastructure, and partner teams (Research, Product, Security, Finance, Legal) on programs that span organizational boundaries&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Drive alignment on programs that cross the hardware/software line—e.g., capacity plans that feed into training schedules, or efficiency work that spans accelerator kernels and serving systems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Own executive communication on program status, risks, and resource needs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You May Be a Good Fit If You:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have 10+ years of experience in technical program management, with 7+ years directly managing TPMs and ideally some experience leading larger TPM organizations&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have built a team or function from scratch before—you know the difference between hiring for a defined role vs. figuring out what the roles should be&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have scaled TPM teams to support rapidly-growing, fast-moving company environments&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have worked across physical and software infrastructure—datacenters, networking, hardware ops, distributed systems, cloud platforms, developer tooling.

However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

      "description": "&lt;p&gt;As a Product Manager for Telemetry Optimization, you will build the control plane that helps customers decide what observability data to collect, keep, and recall, and how to manage agents at scale. You will pair cost and risk controls with simple, auditable experiences for administrators and service owners.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You’ll work closely with Platform and SRE teams who face fast growing telemetry volumes, configuration drift across large fleets, and unpredictable bills that create blind spots during incidents. Your customers are central observability owners, enterprise admins, security and compliance partners, and the service teams they support. You’ll own and build guardrails for agent lifecycle, policy, pipelines, routing, and cost that do not break investigations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;At Datadog, we place value in our office culture - the relationships and collaboration it builds and the creativity it brings to the table.

Discord plays a uniquely important role in the future of gaming. We are focused on making it easier and more fun for people to talk and hang out before, during, and after playing games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Engagement organization at Discord is focused on deepening user engagement and retention—ensuring that as we bring in new users, they stick around and make Discord an irreplaceable part of their daily lives. We work on Discord&#39;s core social systems: voice and messaging. Our mission is to drive repeatable mechanisms that increase engagement across both our core desktop gaming audience and emerging segments like mobile gamers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re looking for an experienced Product Design Manager to lead a team of designers working on one of these strategic themes. You&#39;ll manage designers tackling challenges like making voice calls more discoverable and engaging, creating social feedback loops that keep conversations going, or ensuring Discord&#39;s foundational experiences remain world-class.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a Design Manager, you&#39;ll independently lead your team across a single domain, balancing strategic thinking with hands-on craft leadership. You&#39;ll work closely with cross-functional partners in Product and Engineering to translate Engagement&#39;s strategy into delightful user experiences, while developing your designers and maintaining Discord&#39;s high quality bar.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;What You&#39;ll Be Doing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Develop a team of highly-engaged designers by coaching and instilling a sense of ownership and impact.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Provide direction and guidance of product designers&#39; output, promote partnerships and design process.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build close bonds with your corresponding engineering and product management leaders to influence product strategy and ensure world-class product execution.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Partner with Staff+ designers and XFN partners to define and refine the design portions of the roadmap, ensuring work is appropriately broken down and prioritized.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Set a strong pace for the team and foster a culture of quality by balancing holistic thinking with feature impact, cutting scope when needed without compromising quality.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Make sound first-principle decisions around resourcing and team composition, adapting to changing needs or tuning team dynamics.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Drive design excellence within your team and owned systems; mentor designers on user-centric thinking and risk mitigation.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Occasionally be hands-on with design work, pitching in to support your team and keep them focused on deeper work—however this is primarily a management role.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you should have&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;2+ years of experience as a Design Manager and/or have led at least 2 Product Designers previously within a design team.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;6+ years experience in multi-platform digital products as a Product Designer (or similar role). Especially fluent with mobile product development and consumer products, with experience using prototyping tools to demonstrate product concepts.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A portfolio of work you&#39;ve designed and shipped as well as examples of work you directed delivered by your team. Examples of how you have previously influenced your product teams, organizations or discipline.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;An enjoyment of people leadership. This includes recruiting, training and developing, organization design, and leading by example.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Strong eye for craft. You can identify when work can benefit from more time or investment, identifying gaps in visual or interaction design.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;History of strong partnerships with engineering and product management leadership.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You thrive in ambiguous environments and get excited about figuring out strategies or processes to address them—both in product and internal team structures.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You are a first principles thinker that can work with others to come up with pragmatic solutions.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Designing yourself does not scare you, and you&#39;re happy to jump in to help if needed. You are still a designer even if you don&#39;t do it all the time.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;The US base salary range for this full-time position is $220,000 to $247,500 + equity + benefits.

      "description": "&lt;div class=&quot;content-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discord is used by over 200 million people every month for many different reasons, but there’s one thing that nearly everyone does on our platform:&lt;strong&gt; play video games.&lt;/strong&gt; Over 90% of our users play games, spending a combined 1.5 billion hours playing thousands of unique titles on Discord each month. Discord plays a uniquely important role in the future of gaming. We are focused on making it easier and more fun for people to talk and hang out before, during, and after playing games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Engagement organization at Discord is focused on deepening user engagement and retention—ensuring that as we bring in new users, they stick around and make Discord an irreplaceable part of their daily lives. We work on Discord&#39;s core social systems: voice and messaging. Our mission is to drive repeatable mechanisms that increase engagement across both our core desktop gaming audience and emerging segments like mobile gamers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re looking for an experienced Product Design Manager to lead a team of designers working on one of these strategic themes. You&#39;ll manage designers tackling challenges like making voice calls more discoverable and engaging, creating social feedback loops that keep conversations going, or ensuring Discord&#39;s foundational experiences remain world-class.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a Design Manager, you&#39;ll independently lead your team across a single domain, balancing strategic thinking with hands-on craft leadership. You&#39;ll work closely with cross-functional partners in Product and Engineering to translate Engagement&#39;s strategy into delightful user experiences, while developing your designers and maintaining Discord&#39;s high quality bar.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;What You&#39;ll Be Doing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Develop a team of highly-engaged designers by coaching and instilling a sense of ownership and impact.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Provide direction and guidance of product designers&#39; output, promote partnerships and design process.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build close bonds with your corresponding engineering and product management leaders to influence product strategy and ensure world-class product execution.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Partner with Staff+ designers and XFN partners to define and refine the design portions of the roadmap, ensuring work is appropriately broken down and prioritized.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Set a strong pace for the team and foster a culture of quality by balancing holistic thinking with feature impact, cutting scope when needed without compromising quality.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Make sound first-principle decisions around resourcing and team composition, adapting to changing needs or tuning team dynamics.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Drive design excellence within your team and owned systems; mentor designers on user-centric thinking and risk mitigation.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Occasionally be hands-on with design work, pitching in to support your team and keep them focused on deeper work—however this is primarily a management role.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you should have&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;2+ years of experience as a Design Manager and/or have led at least 2 Product Designers previously within a design team.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;6+ years experience in multi-platform digital products as a Product Designer (or similar role). Especially fluent with mobile product development and consumer products, with experience using prototyping tools to demonstrate product concepts.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A portfolio of work you&#39;ve designed and shipped as well as examples of work you directed delivered by your team. Examples of how you have previously influenced your product teams, organizations or discipline.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;An enjoyment of people leadership. This includes recruiting, training and developing, organization design, and leading by example.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Strong eye for craft. You can identify when work can benefit from more time or investment, identifying gaps in visual or interaction design.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;History of strong partnerships with engineering and product management leadership.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You thrive in ambiguous environments and get excited about figuring out strategies or processes to address them—both in product and internal team structures.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You are a first principles thinker that can work with others to come up with pragmatic solutions.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Designing yourself does not scare you, and you&#39;re happy to jump in to help if needed. You are still a designer even if you don&#39;t do it all the time.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;The US base salary range for this full-time position is $220,000 to $247,500 + equity + benefits. Our salary ranges are determined by role and level. Within the range, individual pay is determined by additional factors, including job-related skills, experience, and relevant education or training. Please note that the compensation details listed in US role postings reflect the base salary only, and do not include equity, or benefits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Discord?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Discord plays a uniquely important role in the future of gaming. We&#39;re a multiplatform, multigenerational and multiplayer platform that helps people deepen their friendships around games and shared interests. We believe games give us a way to have fun with our favorite people, whether listening to music together or grinding in competitive matches for diamond rank. &lt;strong&gt;Join us in our mission! Your future is just a click away!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discord is committed to inclusion and providing reasonable accommodations during the interview process. &lt;/strong&gt;We want you to feel set up for success, so if you are in need of reasonable accommodations, please let your recruiter know.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please see our Applicant and Candidate Privacy Policy for details regarding Discord’s collection and usage of personal information relating to the application and recruitment process by clicking&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://discord.com/terms/applicant-candidate-privacy-policy&quot;&gt;HERE.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco.

As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day.

At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco.

We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day.

At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

      "description": "&lt;div class=&quot;content-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discord is used by over 200 million people every month for many different reasons, but there’s one thing that nearly everyone does on our platform:&lt;strong&gt; play video games.&lt;/strong&gt; Over 90% of our users play games, spending a combined 1.5 billion hours playing thousands of unique titles on Discord each month. Discord plays a uniquely important role in the future of gaming. We are focused on making it easier and more fun for people to talk and hang out before, during, and after playing games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discord&#39;s Product Policy team shapes how millions of people play games and hang out with their friends. The Safety Policy team sits at the heart of this mission, developing the content and product policies that protect users while preserving what makes Discord special: a place built for gaming where friends can talk, play, and have fun together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We&#39;re looking for a Director of Safety Policy to lead policy development for Discord&#39;s consumer products and experiences. This isn&#39;t your typical policy role. You&#39;ll combine deep policy expertise with cutting-edge ML/AI approaches, using LLMs to develop, test, and iterate on policies that work at Discord&#39;s scale. You&#39;ll work at the intersection of user safety, product innovation, and operational excellence, ensuring our policies are both principled and pragmatic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this role, you&#39;ll lead a team responsible for developing Community Guidelines, recommendations policies, and the policy frameworks that shape user experiences across Discord&#39;s consumer products. You&#39;ll partner with Trust &amp;amp; Safety Operations, Engineering, Legal, Product, and cross-functional teams to ensure policies can be enforced consistently and effectively. And because Discord operates under rapidly evolving regulations globally, you&#39;ll need to translate complex regulatory requirements into policies that actually work for our platform and our users.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This role reports to the Senior Director of Product Policy and is based in San Francisco or available remotely within the United States.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you&#39;ll be doing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lead Policy Development: &lt;/strong&gt;Own the creation, iteration, and maintenance of Discord&#39;s core safety policies, including Community Guidelines and recommendations policies. Develop policy frameworks that balance user safety, freedom of expression, and operational feasibility while reflecting Discord&#39;s unique identity as a communications platform purpose-built for people who play games with their friends.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leverage ML &amp;amp; AI for Policy Innovation: &lt;/strong&gt;Use LLMs and other AI technologies to develop, test, and iterate on policy language, enforcement criteria, and operational workflows. Build scalable approaches to policy development that combine human expertise with machine intelligence. Experiment with novel approaches to policy creation.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build and Lead a High-Performing Team: &lt;/strong&gt;Manage, mentor, and grow a team of policy experts who are passionate about user safety and platform integrity. Foster a culture of rigorous thinking, creative problem-solving, and continuous learning. Develop future leaders who can navigate complex policy challenges with both empathy and analytical precision.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bridge Policy and Operations: &lt;/strong&gt;Partner with Trust &amp;amp; Safety teams to ensure policies can be enforced consistently at scale. Co-create enforcement guidance, standard operating procedures, and training materials. Build feedback loops that help policy evolve based on operational reality and emerging harms.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Navigate the Regulatory Landscape: &lt;/strong&gt;Translate requirements from global regulations (DSA, Online Safety Act, platform-specific legislation) into actionable policy frameworks. Work with Legal and Platform Compliance teams to ensure Discord&#39;s policies meet regulatory obligations while preserving user experience. Anticipate regulatory trends and proactively position Discord&#39;s policy approach for future requirements.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support Product Teams: &lt;/strong&gt;Advise product teams on safety risks and policy implications for new features and experiences. Develop frameworks for responsible product development that help teams move quickly while building safety in from the start.&amp;nbsp;Provide clear guidance on policy boundaries and escalation paths for edge cases.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drive Thought Leadership: &lt;/strong&gt;Represent Discord&#39;s policy approach externally through industry forums, academic partnerships, press, and civil society engagement. Contribute to advancing industry best practices in content moderation and platform governance. Build Discord&#39;s reputation as a leader in thoughtful, evidence-based policy development.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you should have&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10+ years of experience&lt;/strong&gt; in trust &amp;amp; safety policy development, content moderation, or platform governance at a global technology company, with demonstrated progression to leadership roles&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Team management experience: &lt;/strong&gt;3+ years leading policy teams of 5+ people, with proven ability to hire, develop, and retain top talent in a fast-paced environment&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regulatory expertise: &lt;/strong&gt;Direct experience developing policies in response to platform regulations (DSA, UK Online Safety Act, Take it Down Act, or similar frameworks). Deep understanding of how regulatory requirements translate into operational reality.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ML for content moderation: &lt;/strong&gt;Hands-on experience using machine learning systems for content moderation, policy enforcement, or risk assessment. Understanding of how ML models work, their limitations, and how to evaluate their performance in safety contexts.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LLM fluency: &lt;/strong&gt;Demonstrated ability to use LLMs and generative AI tools to enhance policy development workflows. Experience could include using LLMs for policy drafting, scenario generation, development of enforcement criteria, creation of training materials, or workflow optimization.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cross-functional partnership:&lt;/strong&gt; Track record of working effectively with diverse stakeholders, including Legal, Engineering, Product, Operations, and Executive teams. Ability to translate between policy principles and technical requirements.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analytical rigor: &lt;/strong&gt;Strong ability to use data, research, and evidence to inform policy decisions. Experience with A/B testing, pilot programs, or other methods for evaluating policy effectiveness.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exceptional communication: &lt;/strong&gt;Ability to explain complex policy concepts clearly to diverse audiences, from front-line moderators to C-suite executives. Experience writing policies, guidance documents, and user-facing communications.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This position is US-based and can be remote but if you live in the Bay Area, you’re welcome to work from our beautiful SF office.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The US base salary range for this full-time position is $280,000 to $315,000 + equity + benefits.
