How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco.

How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is seeking a Director of UI Engineering to lead the teams responsible for building all consumer-facing Claude experiences—including web, mobile, desktop, and browser extensions. In this role, you&#39;ll shape how millions of users interact with Claude daily, driving the technical vision and execution for interfaces that are intuitive, responsive, and push the boundaries of what AI-powered applications can be.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a highly technical leadership role. While you&#39;ll be responsible for building and guiding engineering teams, you&#39;ll remain deeply hands-on— steering architectural decisions and staying close to the work. You&#39;ll partner closely with Product, Design, Research, and Go-to-Market teams to not only build what&#39;s on the roadmap, but to anticipate where the product needs to go next. We&#39;re looking for someone who can see around corners and help us skate to where the puck is going.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re building at an extraordinary pace in a rapidly evolving space. You should thrive in environments where priorities shift quickly, where you&#39;re expected to ship fast without sacrificing quality, and where the problems you&#39;re solving don&#39;t have established playbooks.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Lead and grow the UI engineering teams responsible for Claude&#39;s consumer products across web, mobile (iOS/Android), desktop, and browser extensions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Define the technical vision and architecture for our frontend systems, ensuring they scale with our rapidly growing user base&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Stay deeply technical—participate in design reviews and architectural decisions while maintaining a broad view of the product&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Partner closely with Product and Design to shape product direction, bringing an informed point of view on what we should build and how users will experience it&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Drive engineering excellence through best practices in performance, accessibility, and cross-platform consistency&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build and mentor a world-class team of frontend engineers, creating an environment where people do the best work of their careers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Collaborate across functions—including Research, Trust &amp;amp; Safety, and Go-to-Market—to ensure our products meet the needs of users and the business&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Navigate ambiguity and make sound decisions quickly in a fast-moving environment&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You may be a good fit if you:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have 10+ years of experience building consumer-facing web and mobile applications at scale, with several years in engineering leadership roles&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have led teams that shipped products used by millions of users, with a track record of delivering high-quality, responsive, and accessible interfaces&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Remain deeply technical despite your leadership responsibilities—you can dive into the code, debug complex issues, and make informed architectural tradeoffs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have strong opinions on product and design, developed through years of building consumer experiences, and can advocate effectively for the user&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Excel at cross-functional partnership and can build trust quickly with Product, Design, Research, and other stakeholders&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Thrive in fast-paced, ambiguous environments and can balance speed with quality&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are excited by the challenge of building interfaces for AI-powered products, where the interaction paradigms are still being invented&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Care deeply about craft—you notice the details that make an experience feel polished and intuitive&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong candidates may also have:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience building products across multiple platforms (web, iOS, Android, desktop, browser extensions) and understanding the unique constraints of each&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Background in building real-time, interactive applications where latency and performance are critical&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience with modern frontend frameworks and architectures (React, React Native, TypeScript, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with AI/ML-powered products and the unique UX challenges they present&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A track record of building and scaling engineering teams through periods of rapid growth&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience establishing frontend platform capabilities that enable faster iteration across multiple product surfaces&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deadline to apply&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;None.

We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;About the Role&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As part of the Anthropic security department, the Global Safety, Intelligence and Security team assesses, identifies, and mitigates physical safety and security risks in a manner that best protects Anthropic&#39;s people, assets, operations, and reputation. The Protective Services Program Manager will be responsible for developing, implementing, and managing comprehensive protection strategies for company executives and other key personnel as well as overseeing our vendor executive protection program. This role requires a sophisticated understanding of risk management, proven leadership experience, excellent communication skills, and the ability to operate with discretion in a dynamic technology environment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Responsibilities:&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Design and implement comprehensive executive protection programs and protocols&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Conduct thorough risk assessments and develop mitigation strategies for executive travel, events, and daily operations&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Manage and coordinate executive protection team members and vendor relationships&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Develop and maintain strong relationships with executives, their staff, and key stakeholders&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Create and maintain standard operating procedures for executive protection operations&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Coordinate with various internal teams including Global Security, Travel, and Executive Admin teams&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Utilize protective intelligence gathering and analysis to inform security operations&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Manage program budgets and resource allocation&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Provide regular reporting on program effectiveness and incident metrics&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;You may be a good fit if you:&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have 10+ years of experience in executive protection, with at least 5 years in program management&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Possess strong leadership and interpersonal skills with the ability to interact professionally with C-suite executives and their staff&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have experience building from the ground up or scaling executive protection programs in corporate environments&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Demonstrate excellent judgment and decision-making abilities in high-pressure situations&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are adaptable and can maintain composure in dynamic, fast-paced environments&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have strong project management and organizational skills&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Strong candidates may also have the following:&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Bachelor&#39;s degree in Security Management, Criminal Justice, or related field&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Advanced certifications in Executive Protection or Security Management&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Military or law enforcement background&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience in technology sector security operations&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;International protective operations experience&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Proven track record of building relationships with law enforcement and other public sector security agencies&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deadline to apply:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;None. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expected&amp;nbsp;base compensation for this position is below. Our total compensation package for full-time employees includes equity, benefits, and may include incentive compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Annual Salary:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-range&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$275,000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;divider&quot;&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;$340,000 USD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logistics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education requirements: &lt;/strong&gt;We require at least a Bachelor&#39;s degree in a related field or equivalent experience.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Location-based hybrid policy:&lt;/strong&gt; Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the role:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are looking for backend / platform software engineers to join our Product Foundations org. We build foundational primitives that help accelerate product development across Anthropic. Some examples of what we own and maintain are our core sampling pipeline, our rate limiting platform, and our RAG platform.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We have multiple teams that are currently hiring. Team placement occurs after the interview process, taking into account your interests and experience alongside organizational needs. This flexible approach allows us to match talented engineers with the platform efforts where they&#39;ll have the greatest impact and growth potential:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Product Dev Product: &lt;/strong&gt;We work on maximizing the developer productivity of product engineers at Anthropic. You&#39;ll architect and optimize the critical development infrastructure that powers our AI product development, including dev environments, developer tooling, and CI/CD pipelines. You’ll partner closely with product teams to understand their development workflow and eliminate friction points. Your work will have an extraordinary multiplier effect, enhancing productivity across our entire product organization and accelerating our mission.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Product Platform: &lt;/strong&gt;We provide a set of stable, powerful, and easy to use shared product capabilities leveraged by the Claude.ai, API and other internal product and research teams. You’ll work on our core platform components like rate limiting, LLM sampling and multimodal processing. Our mandate includes developing reusable components, improving system performance, and creating scalable abstractions that accelerate product development across the organization while maintaining high standards for reliability and security.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accounts Platform: &lt;/strong&gt;We build and maintain the critical infrastructure that powers identity and authentication across Anthropic&#39;s product suite. We work closely with product teams, security, support, and trust &amp;amp; safety as customers. We create scalable solutions for user authentication, authorization, role-based access control, and single sign-on that form the backbone of our company&#39;s identity management operations. We maintain a user-centric approach, building reliable systems that our users and company can depend on as we tackle complex challenges at the intersection of security, scalability, and user experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Billing Platform: &lt;/strong&gt;We build and maintain the core billing platform that powers all of Anthropic’s products. You will lead the design and implementation of our billing infrastructure, working at the intersection of our core product, financial systems, and customer-facing features. This role is crucial for scaling our revenue operations, ensuring a seamless customer experience and enables the launch of new and innovative products with complex billing requirements.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Claude Execution:&lt;/strong&gt; We build the infrastructure that enables Claude to safely interact with the outside world through the use of tools. Our team owns the platform that provides secure, isolated execution environments as well as the infrastructure that connects Claude to external services via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). You&#39;ll work on challenging problems at the intersection of security and capability: designing sandboxes that are both secure and performant, building reliable MCP infrastructure, and expanding our platform for enterprise deployments. We collaborate closely with product teams across &lt;a href=&quot;http://claude.ai/&quot;&gt;Claude.ai&lt;/a&gt;, API, and Claude Code to deliver the execution capabilities that make Claude genuinely useful for real-world tasks. Relevant experience includes containerization, secure execution environments, and developing for enterprise requirements.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build and scale platform components to handle Anthropic’s rapid growth&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Design and architect platform components that are composable and deliver value for a variety of use cases&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Collaborate closely with product teams to understand their needs and build platform capabilities that accelerate their feature delivery&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Make build vs buy decisions, evaluating and implementing 3rd party solutions when most impactful&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Set technical direction and vision for various product and platform features&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Partner with research to quickly prototype and launch new capabilities based on research breakthroughs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You might be a good fit if you:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have 6+ years of practical experience as a backend or platform engineer building scalable distributed systems&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have strong coding skills and experience with service-oriented architectures&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have worked in early start-up or otherwise fast moving, rapidly evolving environments, and have ideally built products from 0 to 1&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Take full ownership of your work, navigate ambiguity effectively, and proactively overcome obstacles to deliver results&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are comfortable diving into any part of the system, whether it&#39;s infrastructure, services, or product frontends, to deliver effective solutions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Enjoy working with a fast-paced team tackling cutting-edge problems in AI safety and conversational AI&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Take a product-focused approach and care about building solutions that are robust, scalable, and easy to use&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Enjoy pair programming (we love to pair!)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Software Engineering or comparable experience&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong candidates may also:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have worked with NLP and ML models and understand their capabilities and limitations&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have experience with REST APIs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have experience with React and Frontend frameworks&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expected&amp;nbsp;base compensation for this position is below.

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the role:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are looking for backend / platform software engineers to join our Product Foundations org. We build foundational primitives that help accelerate product development across Anthropic. Some examples of what we own and maintain are our core sampling pipeline, our rate limiting platform, and our RAG platform.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We have multiple teams that are currently hiring. Team placement occurs after the interview process, taking into account your interests and experience alongside organizational needs. This flexible approach allows us to match talented engineers with the platform efforts where they&#39;ll have the greatest impact and growth potential:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Product Dev Product: &lt;/strong&gt;We work on maximizing the developer productivity of product engineers at Anthropic. You&#39;ll architect and optimize the critical development infrastructure that powers our AI product development, including dev environments, developer tooling, and CI/CD pipelines. You’ll partner closely with product teams to understand their development workflow and eliminate friction points. Your work will have an extraordinary multiplier effect, enhancing productivity across our entire product organization and accelerating our mission.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Product Platform: &lt;/strong&gt;We provide a set of stable, powerful, and easy to use shared product capabilities leveraged by the Claude.ai, API and other internal product and research teams. You’ll work on our core platform components like rate limiting, LLM sampling and multimodal processing. Our mandate includes developing reusable components, improving system performance, and creating scalable abstractions that accelerate product development across the organization while maintaining high standards for reliability and security.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accounts Platform: &lt;/strong&gt;We build and maintain the critical infrastructure that powers identity and authentication across Anthropic&#39;s product suite. We work closely with product teams, security, support, and trust &amp;amp; safety as customers. We create scalable solutions for user authentication, authorization, role-based access control, and single sign-on that form the backbone of our company&#39;s identity management operations. We maintain a user-centric approach, building reliable systems that our users and company can depend on as we tackle complex challenges at the intersection of security, scalability, and user experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Billing Platform: &lt;/strong&gt;We build and maintain the core billing platform that powers all of Anthropic’s products. You will lead the design and implementation of our billing infrastructure, working at the intersection of our core product, financial systems, and customer-facing features. This role is crucial for scaling our revenue operations, ensuring a seamless customer experience and enables the launch of new and innovative products with complex billing requirements.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Claude Execution:&lt;/strong&gt; We build the infrastructure that enables Claude to safely interact with the outside world through the use of tools. Our team owns the platform that provides secure, isolated execution environments as well as the infrastructure that connects Claude to external services via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). You&#39;ll work on challenging problems at the intersection of security and capability: designing sandboxes that are both secure and performant, building reliable MCP infrastructure, and expanding our platform for enterprise deployments. We collaborate closely with product teams across &lt;a href=&quot;http://claude.ai/&quot;&gt;Claude.ai&lt;/a&gt;, API, and Claude Code to deliver the execution capabilities that make Claude genuinely useful for real-world tasks. Relevant experience includes containerization, secure execution environments, and developing for enterprise requirements.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build and scale platform components to handle Anthropic’s rapid growth&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Design and architect platform components that are composable and deliver value for a variety of use cases&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Collaborate closely with product teams to understand their needs and build platform capabilities that accelerate their feature delivery&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Make build vs buy decisions, evaluating and implementing 3rd party solutions when most impactful&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Set technical direction and vision for various product and platform features&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Partner with research to quickly prototype and launch new capabilities based on research breakthroughs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You might be a good fit if you:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have 6+ years of practical experience as a backend or platform engineer building scalable distributed systems&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have strong coding skills and experience with service-oriented architectures&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have worked in early start-up or otherwise fast moving, rapidly evolving environments, and have ideally built products from 0 to 1&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Take full ownership of your work, navigate ambiguity effectively, and proactively overcome obstacles to deliver results&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are comfortable diving into any part of the system, whether it&#39;s infrastructure, services, or product frontends, to deliver effective solutions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Enjoy working with a fast-paced team tackling cutting-edge problems in AI safety and conversational AI&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Take a product-focused approach and care about building solutions that are robust, scalable, and easy to use&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Enjoy pair programming (we love to pair!)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Software Engineering or comparable experience&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong candidates may also:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have worked with NLP and ML models and understand their capabilities and limitations&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have experience with REST APIs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have experience with React and Frontend frameworks&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expected&amp;nbsp;base compensation for this position is below.

      "description": "&lt;div class=&quot;content-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why join us&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Brex is the AI-powered spend platform. We help companies spend with confidence with integrated corporate cards, banking, and global payments, plus intuitive software for travel and expenses. Tens of thousands of companies from startups to enterprises — including DoorDash, Flexport, and Compass — use Brex to proactively control spend, reduce costs, and increase efficiency on a global scale.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Working at Brex allows you to push your limits, challenge the status quo, and collaborate with some of the brightest minds in the industry. We’re committed to building a diverse team and inclusive culture and believe your potential should only be limited by how big you can dream. We make this a reality by empowering you with the tools, resources, and support you need to grow your career.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accounting at Brex&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The tax function at Brex sits with the Accounting team, which ensures we produce accurate and timely financial results to stakeholders to guide the business forward.&amp;nbsp; We go beyond closing the books — we automate, iterate, and improve processes in close collaboration with partners across the business. The team also serves as power users and thought leaders for Brex&#39;s own products. We bring precision and curiosity to everything we build, combining deep ownership with a product mindset to help shape the future of finance.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you’ll do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As the Director of Tax, you will own and lead the end-to-end tax function. This role will be responsible for ensuring the compliance of our tax records and filings across our global footprint. You will be the key advisor to executive leadership on all tax matters, continuously refine the overall global tax strategy, and support Brex’s long-term growth through tax optimization initiatives. You will work cross-functionally across the organization within a detail-oriented environment, where creative problem-solving is highly valued. Additionally, you will serve as a key partner to the business as we continue to develop globally tax-compliant products for our customers. This role is critical for establishing scalable, efficient, and compliant tax operations across our growing landscape.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where you&#39;ll work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This role will be based in one of our Brex offices — San Francisco, New York, or Salt Lake City.&amp;nbsp;We are a hybrid environment that combines the energy and connections of being in the office with the benefits and flexibility of working from home. We currently require a minimum of two coordinated days in the office per week, Wednesday and Thursday. Starting February 2, 2026, we will require three days per week in office - Monday, Wednesday and Thursday. As a perk, we also have up to four weeks per year of fully remote work!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Lead all aspects of tax at Brex, including planning, strategy, financial reporting, and compliance&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Prepare or manage the preparation of all domestic and foreign tax and information returns&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Successfully navigate tax audits and examinations by all relevant authorities&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ensure all tax accounts, including provisions, are properly reflected in relevant financial reporting&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Develop and improve tax systems, processes, and policies across the Company&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Manage the oversight of and partnership with external tax advisors as they provide coverage for our local and international operations&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Collaborate with Finance, People, Sales, Engineering, and other functions as needed&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Partner with Payroll and Equity functions in resolving employee-related tax issues&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Prepare journal entries and perform reconciliations over tax-related accounts&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ensure all tax liabilities and obligations are met in a timely manner&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ad-hoc projects, such as tax credits and incentive planning, as necessary&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requirements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;10+ years of public accounting or private industry experience covering domestic and international operations&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ability to both manage a team and operate as an individual contributor to fulfill responsibilities&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Talented and highly motivated with a self-starter mentality&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Strong interpersonal skills and ability to manage deadlines effectively&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Excellent analytical, problem-solving solving and decision-making skills&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Effective verbal, listening, and written communication skills&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;CPA License&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Advanced Microsoft Office skills&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus Points&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Credit card, payment processing, financial services and SaaS industry experience&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Knowledge and experience using NetSuite, Donnelly, Coupa, Looker and/or other data visualization software&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compensation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The expected salary range for this role is $235,040 - $279,110.&amp;nbsp; However, the starting base pay will depend on a number of factors including the candidate’s location, skills, experience, market demands, and internal pay parity. Depending on the position offered, equity and other forms of compensation may be provided as part of a total compensation package.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please be aware, job-seekers may be at risk of targeting by malicious actors looking for personal data.
