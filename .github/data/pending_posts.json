How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day.

At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco.

However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day.

At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco.

However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re looking for an SEO Lead to join Anthropic&#39;s growing marketing team.

You&#39;ll independently define and execute the technical SEO roadmap, drive site experimentation and conversion optimization, and make strategic recommendations that shape how we invest in organic growth. You&#39;ll partner closely with engineering, content, and analytics teams to scale organic discovery — operating with a high degree of autonomy while keeping cross-functional stakeholders aligned.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As AI reshapes how people search for and discover information, you&#39;ll also help define our strategy for emerging search experiences like AI Overviews and answer engines.

But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;About the role&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic&#39;s Inference organization is responsible for serving Claude to millions of users and enterprise customers with the speed, reliability, and efficiency that frontier AI demands. As we scale across multiple accelerator platforms—GPUs, TPUs, and Trainium—the complexity of our development environment grows in lockstep. We&#39;re looking for an Engineering Manager to build and lead a new team focused on developer productivity within Inference: making every engineer in the org dramatically more effective at building, testing, and shipping inference software.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a leadership role at the intersection of infrastructure and developer experience. You&#39;ll own the toolchains, workflows, and feedback loops that Inference engineers depend on every day. Your work will establish priorities to keep our engineering velocity high and driving investments to keep the larger org productive. You&#39;ll partner closely with Anthropic&#39;s central Infrastructure organization (where company-wide developer productivity efforts live) while ensuring the Inference org&#39;s unique needs are met.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This role is ideal for someone who gets deep satisfaction from unblocking other engineers, who thinks in terms of systems and feedback loops, and who can lead a team that operates at the seam between ML infrastructure and software engineering productivity.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build and lead a high-performing team&lt;/strong&gt; focused on developer productivity for the Inference organization, hiring engineers who combine infrastructure expertise with a service-oriented mindset&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Own accelerator toolchain management&lt;/strong&gt; across GPU (CUDA), TPU, and Trainium platforms—keeping compilers, drivers, libraries, and frameworks current, compatible, and well-tested so that Inference engineers can focus on model serving rather than environment issues&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build infrastructure for efficient accelerator usage&lt;/strong&gt; during development—including devbox environments, automation for pre- and post-landing validation, and shared tooling that reduces the friction of working across heterogeneous hardware&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish and drive productivity metrics&lt;/strong&gt; across the Inference org, creating dashboards, alerts, and processes that surface slowdowns early (e.g., smoke tests red for extended periods, build times regressing, toolchain breakages) and ensure rapid resolution&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identify and eliminate inefficiencies&lt;/strong&gt; across Inference engineering workflows—proactively finding bottlenecks, toil, and friction points that slow down the org, and building systems or driving process changes to address them&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Partner with Anthropic&#39;s Infrastructure org&lt;/strong&gt; to align on company-wide developer productivity initiatives, contribute Inference-specific requirements, and avoid duplicating effort while ensuring Inference&#39;s specialized needs (multi-accelerator support, large-scale testing) are well-served&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coach and develop engineers&lt;/strong&gt;

However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts.

      "description": "&lt;div class=&quot;content-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Anthropic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;About the role&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic&#39;s Inference organization is responsible for serving Claude to millions of users and enterprise customers with the speed, reliability, and efficiency that frontier AI demands. As we scale across multiple accelerator platforms—GPUs, TPUs, and Trainium—the complexity of our development environment grows in lockstep. We&#39;re looking for an Engineering Manager to build and lead a new team focused on developer productivity within Inference: making every engineer in the org dramatically more effective at building, testing, and shipping inference software.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a leadership role at the intersection of infrastructure and developer experience. You&#39;ll own the toolchains, workflows, and feedback loops that Inference engineers depend on every day. Your work will establish priorities to keep our engineering velocity high and driving investments to keep the larger org productive. You&#39;ll partner closely with Anthropic&#39;s central Infrastructure organization (where company-wide developer productivity efforts live) while ensuring the Inference org&#39;s unique needs are met.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This role is ideal for someone who gets deep satisfaction from unblocking other engineers, who thinks in terms of systems and feedback loops, and who can lead a team that operates at the seam between ML infrastructure and software engineering productivity.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build and lead a high-performing team&lt;/strong&gt; focused on developer productivity for the Inference organization, hiring engineers who combine infrastructure expertise with a service-oriented mindset&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Own accelerator toolchain management&lt;/strong&gt; across GPU (CUDA), TPU, and Trainium platforms—keeping compilers, drivers, libraries, and frameworks current, compatible, and well-tested so that Inference engineers can focus on model serving rather than environment issues&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build infrastructure for efficient accelerator usage&lt;/strong&gt; during development—including devbox environments, automation for pre- and post-landing validation, and shared tooling that reduces the friction of working across heterogeneous hardware&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish and drive productivity metrics&lt;/strong&gt; across the Inference org, creating dashboards, alerts, and processes that surface slowdowns early (e.g., smoke tests red for extended periods, build times regressing, toolchain breakages) and ensure rapid resolution&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identify and eliminate inefficiencies&lt;/strong&gt; across Inference engineering workflows—proactively finding bottlenecks, toil, and friction points that slow down the org, and building systems or driving process changes to address them&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Partner with Anthropic&#39;s Infrastructure org&lt;/strong&gt; to align on company-wide developer productivity initiatives, contribute Inference-specific requirements, and avoid duplicating effort while ensuring Inference&#39;s specialized needs (multi-accelerator support, large-scale testing) are well-served&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coach and develop engineers&lt;/strong&gt; on your team, providing clear direction, actionable feedback, and growth opportunities in a fast-moving environment&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You may be a good fit if you:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;3+ years of engineering management experience, ideally leading infrastructure, platform, or developer productivity teams&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Strong technical background in systems engineering, build/test infrastructure, or ML infrastructure—you can go deep on toolchain issues, CI/CD pipelines, and developer workflow optimization&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience managing toolchains or development environments for compute-intensive workloads (ML training/inference, HPC, large-scale distributed systems)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with at least one accelerator ecosystem (CUDA/GPU, TPU, or Trainium/AWS Neuron) and an appetite to learn the others&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A track record of defining and using engineering metrics to drive organizational improvement—you&#39;ve built dashboards, set SLOs on developer workflows, or led initiatives to measurably improve engineering velocity&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience partnering across organizational boundaries—you know how to advocate for your team&#39;s needs while contributing to shared infrastructure efforts&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Strong communication skills and the ability to influence without authority across a technical organization&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A genuine passion for making other engineers more productive, and the empathy to understand their pain points deeply&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong candidates may also:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience with ML compiler toolchains (XLA, Triton, NeuronX) or accelerator driver/firmware management at scale&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Background in building or running shared development environments (devboxes, remote development, ephemeral environments) for hardware-dependent workflows&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience with CI/CD systems at scale, particularly for workloads involving accelerator hardware&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with Kubernetes-based development and job scheduling environments&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Prior experience in a developer productivity or platform engineering role at a fast-growing AI/ML company&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The annual compensation range for this role is listed below.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (&quot;OTE&quot;) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Annual Salary:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-range&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$405,000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;divider&quot;&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;$485,000 USD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logistics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education requirements: &lt;/strong&gt;We require at least a Bachelor&#39;s degree in a related field or equivalent experience.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Location-based hybrid policy:&lt;/strong&gt; Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science.

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole.

However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day.

At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day.

At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

Our Forward Deployed Engineers embed directly with strategic customers to ship production AI applications that solve real business problems. As this practice grows, we need a founding leader to build and scale it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=&quot;p5&quot;&gt;As the first FDE Manager, you&#39;ll own the team that sits at the frontier of enterprise AI deployment. You&#39;ll hire and develop a high-performing team of FDEs, set the technical and operational bar for customer engagements, and build the playbooks that turn one-off successes into repeatable patterns. You&#39;ll work hand-in-hand with Engagement Managers who own delivery logistics and stakeholder management, while you ensure your team is shipping quality code, growing technically, and representing Anthropic at the highest level in customer environments.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=&quot;p5&quot;&gt;This is a player-coach role with a strong bias toward leadership. You&#39;ll stay close enough to the technical work to review architectures, debug production issues, and pair with your team when it matters — but your primary impact will come from the people you hire, the standards you set, and the culture you create. You&#39;ll partner cross-functionally with Sales, Product, and Engineering to shape how Anthropic serves its most strategic customers, and your team&#39;s field insights will directly influence product direction.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=&quot;p5&quot;&gt;This role requires someone who thrives in ambiguity and is energized by building from zero to one. You&#39;ll be defining what good looks like for FDE management at Anthropic — there is no existing playbook to follow.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=&quot;p6&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul class=&quot;ul1&quot;&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;li7&quot;&gt;Hire, develop, and retain a world-class team of Forward Deployed Engineers. Set a high bar for technical talent and customer instincts.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;li7&quot;&gt;Conduct regular 1:1s, provide technical mentorship, and invest in the career growth of each team member.

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Anthropic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=&quot;p5&quot;&gt;Anthropic&#39;s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=&quot;p5&quot;&gt;Anthropic is building the Applied AI team to help the world&#39;s most ambitious organizations adopt Claude in ways that are transformative, safe, and lasting. Our Forward Deployed Engineers embed directly with strategic customers to ship production AI applications that solve real business problems. As this practice grows, we need a founding leader to build and scale it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=&quot;p5&quot;&gt;As the first FDE Manager, you&#39;ll own the team that sits at the frontier of enterprise AI deployment. You&#39;ll hire and develop a high-performing team of FDEs, set the technical and operational bar for customer engagements, and build the playbooks that turn one-off successes into repeatable patterns. You&#39;ll work hand-in-hand with Engagement Managers who own delivery logistics and stakeholder management, while you ensure your team is shipping quality code, growing technically, and representing Anthropic at the highest level in customer environments.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=&quot;p5&quot;&gt;This is a player-coach role with a strong bias toward leadership. You&#39;ll stay close enough to the technical work to review architectures, debug production issues, and pair with your team when it matters — but your primary impact will come from the people you hire, the standards you set, and the culture you create. You&#39;ll partner cross-functionally with Sales, Product, and Engineering to shape how Anthropic serves its most strategic customers, and your team&#39;s field insights will directly influence product direction.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=&quot;p5&quot;&gt;This role requires someone who thrives in ambiguity and is energized by building from zero to one. You&#39;ll be defining what good looks like for FDE management at Anthropic — there is no existing playbook to follow.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=&quot;p6&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul class=&quot;ul1&quot;&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;li7&quot;&gt;Hire, develop, and retain a world-class team of Forward Deployed Engineers. Set a high bar for technical talent and customer instincts.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;li7&quot;&gt;Conduct regular 1:1s, provide technical mentorship, and invest in the career growth of each team member.

      "job_description": "&lt;div class=&quot;content-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Anthropic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Cloud Inference team scales and optimizes Claude to serve the massive audiences of developers and enterprise companies across AWS, GCP, Azure, and future cloud service providers (CSPs). We own the end-to-end product of Claude on each cloud platform—from API integration and intelligent request routing to inference execution, capacity management, and day-to-day operations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our engineers are extremely high leverage: we simultaneously drive multiple major revenue streams while optimizing one of Anthropic&#39;s most precious resources—compute. As we expand to more cloud platforms, the complexity of managing inference efficiently across providers with different hardware, networking stacks, and operational models grows significantly. We need engineers who can navigate these platform differences, build robust abstractions that work across providers, and make smart infrastructure decisions that keep us cost-effective at massive scale.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Your work will increase the scale at which our services operate, accelerate our ability to reliably launch new frontier models and innovative features to customers across all platforms, and ensure our LLMs meet rigorous safety, performance, and security standards.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What You&#39;ll Do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Design and build infrastructure that serves Claude across multiple CSPs, accounting for differences in compute hardware, networking, APIs, and operational models&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Collaborate with CSP partner engineering teams to resolve operational issues, influence provider roadmaps, and stand up end-to-end serving on new cloud platforms&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Design and evolve CI/CD automation systems, including validation and deployment pipelines, that reliably ship new model versions to millions of users across cloud platforms without regressions&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Design interfaces and tooling abstractions across CSPs that enable cost-effective inference management, scale across providers, and reduce per-platform complexity&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Contribute to capacity planning and autoscaling strategies that dynamically match supply with demand across CSP validation and production workloads&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Optimize inference cost and performance across providers—designing workload placement and routing systems that direct requests to the most cost-effective accelerator and region&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Contribute to inference features that must work consistently across all platforms&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Analyze observability data across providers to identify performance bottlenecks, cost anomalies, and regressions, and drive remediation based on real-world production workloads&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You May Be a Good Fit If You:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have significant software engineering experience, with a strong background in high-performance, large-scale distributed systems serving millions of users&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have experience building or operating services on at least one major cloud platform (AWS, GCP, or Azure), with exposure to Kubernetes, Infrastructure as Code or container orchestration&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have strong interest in inference&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Thrive in cross-functional collaboration with both internal teams and external partners&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are a fast learner who can quickly ramp up on new technologies, hardware platforms, and provider ecosystems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are highly autonomous and self-driven, taking ownership of problems end-to-end with a bias toward flexibility and high-impact work&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Pick up slack, even when it goes outside your job description&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong Candidates May Also Have Experience With&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Direct experience working with CSP partner teams to scale infrastructure or products across multiple platforms, navigating differences in networking, security, privacy, billing, and managed service offerings&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A background in building platform-agnostic tooling or abstraction layers that work across cloud providers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Hands-on experience with capacity management, cost optimization, or resource planning at scale across heterogeneous environments&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Strong familiarity with LLM inference optimization, batching, caching, and serving strategies&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience with Machine learning infrastructure including GPUs, TPUs, Trainium, or other AI accelerators&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Background designing and building CI/CD systems that automate deployment and validation across cloud environments&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Solid understanding of multi-region deployments, geographic routing, and global traffic management&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Proficiency in Python or

degree in a related field or equivalent experience.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Location-based hybrid policy:&lt;/strong&gt; Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marketing Events Lead, Enterprise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As the Enterprise Events Lead at Anthropic, you will own the development and execution of enterprise-focused events that accelerate pipeline, deepen customer relationships, and elevate Anthropic&#39;s brand presence with key enterprise audiences. You will be responsible for designing and delivering high-impact event experiences—from major industry conferences to hosted summits, and partner activations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In this role, you&#39;ll collaborate closely with Sales, Partnerships, Product Marketing, and Creative teams to ensure every event touchpoint reinforces Anthropic&#39;s position as a leader in safe, frontier AI. You&#39;ll bring a strategic mindset grounded in data, a talent for flawless execution under pressure, and the ability to translate complex enterprise goals into compelling in-person and hybrid experiences. This is a high-visibility role with significant cross-functional impact, ideal for someone who thrives at the intersection of strategy and logistics in a fast-moving environment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Lead the development and execution of enterprise events, aligning programs to pipeline generation, account engagement, and brand objectives&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Manage a team of full time and contracted employees&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Conceptualize and produce hosted events such as executive roundtables, customer summits, and intimate dinners that support account-based marketing goals&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Collaborate with Sales and Partnerships teams to optimize meeting programs, briefing schedules, and on-site engagement strategies at events&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Partner with Creative Studio on experience design, ensuring Anthropic and Claude brands are represented consistently and compellingly&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Manage end-to-end event logistics including vendor relationships, budgets, contracts, staffing plans, and timelines&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Develop pre-event and post-event communications, including &quot;Know Before You Go&quot; guides, staff and speaker training, and attendee follow-up plans&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Establish and track event KPIs—including lead generation, pipeline influence, meeting volume, and attendee engagement—to measure ROI and inform future strategy&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build scalable event processes, playbooks, and documentation to support Anthropic&#39;s growing event portfolio&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Manage relationships with external event agencies, vendors, and venue partners&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Travel on-site to events to provide hands-on logistics management and ensure seamless execution&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Drive continuous improvement through post-event analysis and stakeholder feedback&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You may be a good fit if you:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have 15+ years of experience in enterprise event marketing, field marketing, or a related role, ideally at a high-growth B2B technology company&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have a proven track record of executing large-scale conferences, trade shows, and hosted executive events that drive measurable business outcomes&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are highly organized with exceptional project management skills and the ability to manage multiple complex events simultaneously&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have experience partnering with enterprise sales teams to align event programs with pipeline and revenue goals&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are a clear, effective communicator who can collaborate across functions—from Creative and Marketing to Sales and Executive leadership&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have strong budget management experience, including vendor negotiation and contract management&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are comfortable with data and analytics, using event metrics to optimize programs and demonstrate ROI&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Thrive in fast-paced, ambiguous environments and can adapt quickly when priorities shift&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are willing and excited to travel regularly (approximately 40% of the time) for on-site event execution&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have a genuine interest in AI and care about ensuring that transformative AI systems are developed and deployed responsibly&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong candidates may also:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have experience with event technology platforms (e.g., Splash, Cvent)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have experience building an enterprise events function or program from an early stage&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Bring a strong network of event industry contacts, including venues, production agencies, and AV partners&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have experience with account-based marketing (ABM) strategies and how events fit within a broader demand generation ecosystem&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deadline to apply: None.

However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses.

Our teams develop AI agents that don’t just surface insights—they take action, optimizing spend, managing workflows, and making real-time decisions on behalf of our customers.

You’ll write a significant amount of production code, set the quality bar, and shape how agentic systems integrate with Brex’s core workflows.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a deeply product-driven role.

Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day.

At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco.

However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day.

At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

Learn more about why we are one of the Best Companies to Work for in Texas.\n\nFull-Time\n\nNights\n\n7p-7a\n\n84 hour plan (36 hours one week, 48 hours following week)\n\nThe Emergency Center is a level 1 trauma center 64 bed unit which includes a 7 bed pediatric emergency area. The Emergency Center provides a unique opportunity to experience a variety of patient situations including care of trauma, cardiac, stroke, pediatric, and burn patients. While in the Emergency Center you will orient to all areas of the Emergency Center.\n\nTriage : Triage training will offer you the best view of how the emergency center flows. As a triage nurse you are the decision maker for each patient that is waiting to be seen. You are instructed on the ESI 5 tier index triage system and will begin using this in making decisions on how sick a patient may be and if it is safe for them to wait or not. This again is the most important part of your orientation, because it will carry over into your patient care as a primary nurse to all patients in the Emergency Center. As an experienced nurse, you may have previously used this system and therefore, you will adapt to how this Emergency Center utilizes ESI.\n\nGeneral Medical : Offers a comprehensive experience caring for all types of patients. You will care for patients that are stable to emergently needing care. This area is where you will learn the flow of the Emergency Center and all of the documentation and functionality of the EC.\n\nSuper-Fast Track : Offers the opportunity to explore patients that are very stable and only need one to two diagnostics to come to a disposition. This is a very fast paced area and will really offer you a chance to do focused assessments rather than extensive assessments. You will become very proficient in learning how to focus on the true problem the patient has.\n\nCritical Care : This zone of the Emergency Center offers the opportunity to explore a wide array of pathophysiology. This patient population includes multi-system organ failure, respiratory failure, diabetic emergencies, drug overdoses, autoimmune crisis, and many other critically ill patients.\n\nTrauma Care : Offers a variety of opportunities for advanced patient care in the region’s only Level I Trauma Center. You will care for patients immediately after a traumatic event and will assist the surgery team, orthopedics, neurosurgery team and burn team deciding the further plan of care for that patient. The Burn Center is the region’s only verified burn center. You will care for burns and other soft tissue injuries such as toxic epidermal necrolysis, necrotizing soft tissue infections, and snakebites.\n\nRegistered professional nurse who assesses, implements or delegates, plans, and evaluates total nursing care and functions in accordance with established philosophy, providing and directing patient care for a group of patients.

      "job_description": "&lt;p&gt;As a Product Manager for Telemetry Optimization, you will build the control plane that helps customers decide what observability data to collect, keep, and recall, and how to manage agents at scale. You will pair cost and risk controls with simple, auditable experiences for administrators and service owners.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You’ll work closely with Platform and SRE teams who face fast growing telemetry volumes, configuration drift across large fleets, and unpredictable bills that create blind spots during incidents. Your customers are central observability owners, enterprise admins, security and compliance partners, and the service teams they support.

Publish dashboards and reviews with stakeholders.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ship a visual pipeline and policy experience for sampling, filtering, redaction, enrichment, routing, and retention, with simulation, staged rollout, and audit trails.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Introduce usage aware governance, including utility scoring, team level quotas and budgets, caps, and alerts that align cost with value.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Enable source side optimization, including edge processing and pre-aggregation, with measurable reduction targets and clear ROI.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Provide APIs and tooling so customers can integrate fleet and pipeline changes into CI or automation workflows, including safe approvals.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ensure secure, auditable operations with role based access to fleet actions like configuration changes, upgrades, and troubleshooting. Establish least privilege defaults.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Support customers using Datadog Agents, OTel collectors or Observability Pipelines. Promote standards pragmatically where they reduce friction.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Partner with Sales, Solutions, Marketing, Finance, Legal, and Support on rollouts, pricing inputs, enablement, and customer adoption.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who You Are&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;6+ years as a Product Manager in data platforms, observability, or adjacent infrastructure.

Hands on familiarity with Datadog Agent, Fluent Bit, Vector, or similar.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Proven ability to balance the trade-offs between data utility (completeness, freshness), security (PII/redaction), and cost in real-time streaming pipelines.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience delivering or operating rehydration, tiering, or archive patterns, or adjacent storage lifecycle features.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Proven work on usage aware cost controls like quotas, budgets, or utility scoring, and ability to partner with FinOps to prove ROI.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Comfortable with Kubernetes and large fleet operations, including staged rollouts, automation, and incident safe changes.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Familiar with data protection in pipelines, including PII obfuscation, redaction, tokenization, and compliance workflows.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Excellent communicator who partners well with enterprise admins, security and compliance leaders, SREs, and engineering teams, and who writes crisp PRDs and migration playbooks.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Bonus: open source contributions or ecosystem experience with tools like OpenTelemetry (OTel), New Relic, Cribl, Edge Delta, or Mezmo.

      "description": "&lt;p&gt;As a Product Manager for Telemetry Optimization, you will build the control plane that helps customers decide what observability data to collect, keep, and recall, and how to manage agents at scale. You will pair cost and risk controls with simple, auditable experiences for administrators and service owners.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You’ll work closely with Platform and SRE teams who face fast growing telemetry volumes, configuration drift across large fleets, and unpredictable bills that create blind spots during incidents. Your customers are central observability owners, enterprise admins, security and compliance partners, and the service teams they support. You’ll own and build guardrails for agent lifecycle, policy, pipelines, routing, and cost that do not break investigations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;At Datadog, we place value in our office culture - the relationships and collaboration it builds and the creativity it brings to the table. We operate as a hybrid workplace to ensure our Datadogs can create a work-life harmony that best fits them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What You’ll Do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Own the strategy for a unified governance and fleet control plane that spans agent lifecycle, configuration at scale, upgrades, and policy enforcement. Partner with SRE, Platform, Security, Finance, Product, Support, and GTM.&lt;br&gt;Define success metrics that tie governance to outcomes such as controlled ingest, reduced cardinality, faster investigations, and predictable bills. Publish dashboards and reviews with stakeholders.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ship a visual pipeline and policy experience for sampling, filtering, redaction, enrichment, routing, and retention, with simulation, staged rollout, and audit trails.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Introduce usage aware governance, including utility scoring, team level quotas and budgets, caps, and alerts that align cost with value.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Enable source side optimization, including edge processing and pre-aggregation, with measurable reduction targets and clear ROI.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Provide APIs and tooling so customers can integrate fleet and pipeline changes into CI or automation workflows, including safe approvals.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ensure secure, auditable operations with role based access to fleet actions like configuration changes, upgrades, and troubleshooting. Establish least privilege defaults.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Support customers using Datadog Agents, OTel collectors or Observability Pipelines. Promote standards pragmatically where they reduce friction.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Partner with Sales, Solutions, Marketing, Finance, Legal, and Support on rollouts, pricing inputs, enablement, and customer adoption.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who You Are&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;6+ years as a Product Manager in data platforms, observability, or adjacent infrastructure. Experience owning agent lifecycle and configuration at large scale.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Strong understanding of telemetry signals and pipelines. Hands on familiarity with Datadog Agent, Fluent Bit, Vector, or similar.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Proven ability to balance the trade-offs between data utility (completeness, freshness), security (PII/redaction), and cost in real-time streaming pipelines.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience delivering or operating rehydration, tiering, or archive patterns, or adjacent storage lifecycle features.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Proven work on usage aware cost controls like quotas, budgets, or utility scoring, and ability to partner with FinOps to prove ROI.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Comfortable with Kubernetes and large fleet operations, including staged rollouts, automation, and incident safe changes.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Familiar with data protection in pipelines, including PII obfuscation, redaction, tokenization, and compliance workflows.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Excellent communicator who partners well with enterprise admins, security and compliance leaders, SREs, and engineering teams, and who writes crisp PRDs and migration playbooks.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Bonus: open source contributions or ecosystem experience with tools like OpenTelemetry (OTel), New Relic, Cribl, Edge Delta, or Mezmo. Experience with CI integrations and major clouds.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Datadog values people from all walks of life.

At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco.

And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Safeguards Engineering builds and operates the infrastructure that keeps Anthropic&#39;s AI systems safe in production — the classifiers, detection pipelines, evaluation platforms, and monitoring systems that sit between our models and the real world. That infrastructure needs to be not just correct, but &lt;em&gt;reliable&lt;/em&gt;: when a safety-critical pipeline goes down or degrades, the consequences can be serious, and they can be invisible until someone looks closely.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a Technical Program Manager for Safeguards Infrastructure and Evals, you&#39;ll own the operational health and forward momentum of this stack. Your primary responsibility is driving reliability — owning the incident-response and post-mortem process, ensuring SLOs are defined and met in partnership with various teams, and making sure that when things go wrong, the right people know, the right actions get taken, and those actions actually get closed out. Alongside that ongoing operational rhythm, you&#39;ll coordinate the larger platform investments: migrations, eval-platform improvements, and the cross-team dependencies that connect them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This role sits at the intersection of operations and program management. It requires genuine technical depth — you need to understand how these systems work well enough to triage effectively, judge what&#39;s actually safety-critical versus what can wait, and have informed conversations with the engineers building and maintaining them. But the core of the job is keeping the machine running well and the work moving.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What You&#39;ll Do:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Own the Safeguards Engineering ops review - &lt;/strong&gt;Drive the recurring cadence that keeps the team informed and coordinated: surfacing recent incidents and failures, bringing visibility to reliability trends, and making sure the right people are in the room when decisions need to be made. This is the heartbeat of how Safeguards Eng stays ahead of operational risk.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drive incident tracking and post-mortem execution - &lt;/strong&gt;When incidents happen — and in this space, they happen regularly — you&#39;ll make sure they get followed through properly. That means tracking incidents across the organization (including those owned by partner teams like Inference), ensuring post-mortems get written, and most critically, making sure the action items that come out of them actually get done. Closing the loop on post-mortem actions is one of the highest-leverage things this role does.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish and maintain SLOs with partner teams - &lt;/strong&gt;Work with Safeguards Engineering teams and key partners — particularly Inference and Cloud Inference — to define service-level objectives for safety-critical pipelines. Then build the tracking and reporting that makes it possible to tell whether those SLOs are being met, and surface it when they&#39;re not.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintain runbook quality and incident-ownership clarity - &lt;/strong&gt;Safety-critical systems need clear playbooks for when things go wrong. Partner with engineering leads to keep runbooks accurate, actionable, and up to date — and ensure that ownership of incidents (including for areas like account-banning false positives and CSAM detection) is unambiguous so that nothing falls through the cracks during an active incident.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drive platform migrations and infrastructure projects - &lt;/strong&gt;Own the program management for the larger infrastructure work on the roadmap: migrating the infra from one platform to the next, moving from one incident platform to the next and from one cloud system monitoring to another, and other migrations as they come. These are cross-team efforts with real dependencies — your job is to keep them sequenced, on track, and connected to the teams that need them.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coordinate evals platform improvements - &lt;/strong&gt;Partner with the evals engineering team to drive improvements to the evaluation platform — including self-serve capabilities and the broader eval factory infrastructure. Help scope the work, track dependencies on other Safeguards systems, and make sure the evals platform is keeping pace with the team&#39;s needs.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You might be a good fit if you:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have solid technical program management experience, particularly in operational or infrastructure-heavy environments — you&#39;re comfortable owning a mix of ongoing operational cadences and discrete project work simultaneously.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Understand how production ML systems work well enough to triage incidents intelligently and have substantive conversations with engineers about what&#39;s going wrong and why — you don&#39;t need to write the code, but you need to follow the technical thread.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are energized by closing loops. Post-mortem action items that never get done, SLOs that no one checks, runbooks that go stale — these things bother you, and you know how to build the processes and follow-ups that fix them.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Can work effectively across team boundaries — comfortable coordinating with partner teams (like Inference) where you don&#39;t have direct authority, and skilled at keeping shared work moving through influence and clear communication.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Thrive in environments where the work shifts between &quot;keep the lights on&quot; and &quot;build something new&quot; — and can context-switch between incident follow-ups and longer-horizon platform projects without dropping either.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have experience with or strong interest in AI safety — you understand why the reliability of a safety-critical pipeline is a different kind of problem than the reliability of a product feature, and that distinction motivates you.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong candidates may also:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have experience with SRE practices, incident management frameworks, or on-call operations at scale.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have worked on or with evaluation infrastructure for ML systems — understanding how evals get designed, run, and interpreted.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have experience driving infrastructure migrations in complex, multi-team environments — particularly where the migration touches operational systems that can&#39;t go offline.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Be familiar with monitoring and alerting tooling (PagerDuty, Datadog, or equivalents) and the operational culture around them.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deadline to apply:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;None, applications will be received on a rolling basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The annual compensation range for this role is listed below.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (&quot;OTE&quot;) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Annual Salary:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-range&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$290,000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;divider&quot;&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;$365,000 USD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logistics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education requirements: &lt;/strong&gt;We require at least a Bachelor&#39;s degree in a related field or equivalent experience.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Location-based hybrid policy:&lt;/strong&gt; Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time.

This is a high-stakes, high-visibility role at the center of our business strategy, where experimentation, subscription dynamics, and product development converge. You will work closely with Monetization product and engineering leadership, the finance team, and senior company executives to produce forecasts that are not only accurate but explainable, trusted, and decision-ready.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are looking for someone who deeply understands the statistical and strategic challenges of modeling constantly evolving consumer subscription products. You will need to separate signal from noise, lead investigations when reality diverges from prediction, clearly communicate the business and product impacts of modeling outcomes, and give senior leaders confidence in your numbers when the stakes are high.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:brain:&amp;nbsp; You will...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lead the financial forecasting system.&lt;/strong&gt; Drive methodology, implementation, maintenance, and delivery as the technical owner of our revenue forecasting stack, in close partnership with the finance team. Publish forecasts that serve as the source of truth for company-wide planning and investor-facing decisions.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Model subscription + experimentation dynamics. &lt;/strong&gt;Develop modeling architectures that account for experimental lift, cohort behavior, seasonality, and more, making it clear what’s real impact and what’s noise across the hundreds of experiments Duolingo runs each quarter.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investigate deviations and lead with insight. &lt;/strong&gt;When forecasts miss, lead the root-cause analysis by quantifying drivers of over- or under-performance (e.g. product changes, user behavior shifts, macro trends), collaborating across functions, and clearly communicating what happened and why to senior leadership. Build and be responsible for the statistics, tools, and dashboards that scale these insights across the company.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advance the technical frontier. &lt;/strong&gt;Push our evolution beyond traditional time-series extrapolation and toward more sophisticated approaches such as cohort-based forecasting, retention chaining, and/or causal impact modeling, grounded in business realism and model interpretability.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mentor and influence. &lt;/strong&gt;Serve as a technical mentor to data scientists across the organization, set a high standard for modeling, communication, and statistical rigor, and develop roadmaps for forecasting infrastructure and innovation.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:check:&amp;nbsp; You have...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forecasting domain expertise&lt;/strong&gt;. 6+ years of proven experience building production-grade forecasting systems, with deep applied knowledge of subscription models and understanding of churn dynamics, cohort behaviors, and retention curves.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advanced technical and statistical skills. &lt;/strong&gt;Advanced degree (Masters or PhD) in Data Science, Economics, Statistics, or a related quantitative field with experience assessing and applying theoretical approaches in real-world situations (ex. when to use Bayesian structural models, when causal inference is vital, when a robust heuristic is better than over-fitting noise, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Executive communication&lt;/strong&gt;. Experience distilling uncertainty, nuance, and model tradeoffs into streamlined, actionable narratives for finance and senior leadership partners. Ability to communicate complex forecasting logic clearly and stand by your work in moments of ambiguity.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collaborative style. &lt;/strong&gt;Track record of collaboration across technical and non-technical teams, with a consistent record of integrating feedback, aligning across functions, and operating with a strong sense of ownership and service.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Business responsiveness. &lt;/strong&gt;Strong judgment when balancing model complexity, interpretability, and speed of development, sometimes sacrificing exactness for interpretability. Adapt quickly to fast-paced product and business changes and make model tradeoffs accordingly.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Code quality and reproducibility.&lt;/strong&gt; Expertise writing clean, well-documented code in Python and SQL, and building reliable, multipurpose production pipelines.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experience in high-experimentation environments.&lt;/strong&gt; Past work in organizations where A/B testing is constant, complicating training data and historical baselines.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We post a multi-level salary range for all of our roles.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is not inclusive of the rest of our awesome portfolio that includes equity compensation and world-class benefits.

You’ll have limitless learning opportunities and daily collaborations with world-class minds — while doing work that’s both meaningful and fun.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Join our life-changing mission to develop education for our half a billion (and growing!) learners around the world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Read &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.duolingo.com/?utm_source=greenhouse.com&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=generalblog_gh_091224&quot;&gt;our blog&lt;/a&gt; to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Duolingo is seeking a Staff Data Scientist to own and evolve our most critical financial forecasting systems. This is a high-stakes, high-visibility role at the center of our business strategy, where experimentation, subscription dynamics, and product development converge. You will work closely with Monetization product and engineering leadership, the finance team, and senior company executives to produce forecasts that are not only accurate but explainable, trusted, and decision-ready.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are looking for someone who deeply understands the statistical and strategic challenges of modeling constantly evolving consumer subscription products. You will need to separate signal from noise, lead investigations when reality diverges from prediction, clearly communicate the business and product impacts of modeling outcomes, and give senior leaders confidence in your numbers when the stakes are high.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:brain:&amp;nbsp; You will...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lead the financial forecasting system.&lt;/strong&gt; Drive methodology, implementation, maintenance, and delivery as the technical owner of our revenue forecasting stack, in close partnership with the finance team. Publish forecasts that serve as the source of truth for company-wide planning and investor-facing decisions.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Model subscription + experimentation dynamics. &lt;/strong&gt;Develop modeling architectures that account for experimental lift, cohort behavior, seasonality, and more, making it clear what’s real impact and what’s noise across the hundreds of experiments Duolingo runs each quarter.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investigate deviations and lead with insight. &lt;/strong&gt;When forecasts miss, lead the root-cause analysis by quantifying drivers of over- or under-performance (e.g. product changes, user behavior shifts, macro trends), collaborating across functions, and clearly communicating what happened and why to senior leadership. Build and be responsible for the statistics, tools, and dashboards that scale these insights across the company.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advance the technical frontier. &lt;/strong&gt;Push our evolution beyond traditional time-series extrapolation and toward more sophisticated approaches such as cohort-based forecasting, retention chaining, and/or causal impact modeling, grounded in business realism and model interpretability.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mentor and influence. &lt;/strong&gt;Serve as a technical mentor to data scientists across the organization, set a high standard for modeling, communication, and statistical rigor, and develop roadmaps for forecasting infrastructure and innovation.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:check:&amp;nbsp; You have...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forecasting domain expertise&lt;/strong&gt;. 6+ years of proven experience building production-grade forecasting systems, with deep applied knowledge of subscription models and understanding of churn dynamics, cohort behaviors, and retention curves.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advanced technical and statistical skills. &lt;/strong&gt;Advanced degree (Masters or PhD) in Data Science, Economics, Statistics, or a related quantitative field with experience assessing and applying theoretical approaches in real-world situations (ex. when to use Bayesian structural models, when causal inference is vital, when a robust heuristic is better than over-fitting noise, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Executive communication&lt;/strong&gt;. Experience distilling uncertainty, nuance, and model tradeoffs into streamlined, actionable narratives for finance and senior leadership partners. Ability to communicate complex forecasting logic clearly and stand by your work in moments of ambiguity.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collaborative style. &lt;/strong&gt;Track record of collaboration across technical and non-technical teams, with a consistent record of integrating feedback, aligning across functions, and operating with a strong sense of ownership and service.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Business responsiveness. &lt;/strong&gt;Strong judgment when balancing model complexity, interpretability, and speed of development, sometimes sacrificing exactness for interpretability. Adapt quickly to fast-paced product and business changes and make model tradeoffs accordingly.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Code quality and reproducibility.&lt;/strong&gt; Expertise writing clean, well-documented code in Python and SQL, and building reliable, multipurpose production pipelines.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experience in high-experimentation environments.&lt;/strong&gt; Past work in organizations where A/B testing is constant, complicating training data and historical baselines.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We post a multi-level salary range for all of our roles.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is not inclusive of the rest of our awesome portfolio that includes equity compensation and world-class benefits.

However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day.

At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco.

You’ll determine what to build, what to extend, and what to replace as needs evolve&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Build AI-augmented pipelines for content generation, real-time adaptation, assessment delivery, and quality assurance — working closely with the education team to understand what these systems need to do pedagogically&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Design platform capabilities that enable genuinely new kinds of empowering learning experiences — adaptive paths, competency-based progression, AI-evaluated demonstrations of skill — not just digital versions of traditional courses&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Interface with Anthropic&#39;s security, infrastructure, and data teams to ensure education systems meet organizational standards and integrate cleanly with existing architecture&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Build platform abstractions that let non-engineers on the team configure, extend, and experiment with educational experiences without engineering bottlenecks&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Make product-level decisions about how the platform works — you&#39;re shaping what the learning experience is, not just serving it&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You may be a good fit if you have:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;7+ years of software engineering experience, with demonstrated ability to take a platform from zero to production at scale&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Genuine passion for education — you think about how people learn, you have opinions about what educational technology should look like in an AI-native world, and you want to build it&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A strong eye for quality educational content, with a sense of the complex systems that produce it&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Full-stack engineering skills with particular strength in backend systems: databases, APIs, authentication, reliability, and infrastructure&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Experience building and operating platforms that serve many concurrent users reliably&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Comfort with ambiguity and ownership: you&#39;ll need to translate pedagogical intent into technical architecture without heavy specification&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Experience interfacing with security and infrastructure teams to meet organizational requirements while maintaining development velocity&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A working practice of using AI tools in your own engineering workflows — and genuine curiosity about how AI fundamentally changes what educational platforms can be&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong candidates may also have:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Experience building or significantly contributing to learning platforms, credentialing systems, or educational technology products&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Background in or exposure to learning science, instructional design, or educational research&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Experience with SSO/identity (SAML, OAuth), badging standards (Open Badges), or LTI integrations&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Familiarity with building systems that incorporate LLM capabilities as core infrastructure&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Prior work at a high-growth company where you built platform infrastructure that other teams depended on&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Experience designing systems that non-technical users configure and operate&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The annual compensation range for this role is listed below.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (&quot;OTE&quot;) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Annual Salary:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-range&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$300,000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;divider&quot;&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;$405,000 USD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logistics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education requirements: &lt;/strong&gt;We require at least a Bachelor&#39;s degree in a related field or equivalent experience.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Location-based hybrid policy:&lt;/strong&gt; Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",
