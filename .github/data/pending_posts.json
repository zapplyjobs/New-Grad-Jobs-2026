We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the Team As part of the Anthropic security department, the compliance team owns understanding security and AI safety expectations, as established by regulators, customers and (nascent) industry norms (which we also seek to influence). The compliance team uses this understanding to provide direction to internal partners on the priorities of security and safety requirements they must meet. The compliance team assures regulators and customers that those expectations are met by earning security credentials and responding to direct inquiry about Anthropics security program from auditors, customers and partners. This opportunity is unique, as we work to secure today’s most novel and valuable asset types, we must build a new kind of compliance program, assuring the safety of artificial intelligence capabilities. Responsibilities: Plan and lead engagements with independent assessors to earn security and privacy certifications and attestations important to Anthropic customers and enterprise partnerships, and to meet regulatory obligations. Understand how Anthropic's security and privacy capabilities across major cloud platforms implement common frameworks (e.g., NIST 800-53, NIST 800-171, ISO 27001, ISO 27701, CSA CCM, and SOC 2) Build scalable audit management processes and documentation systems that will support future expansion to additional geographies and compliance frameworks Write, update and enact policies capturing security, privacy, and AI safety requirements. Maintain and enhance Anthropic's system of security controls through audit readiness, recordkeeping, and cross-functional communication You may be a good fit if you: Have 8+ years of progressive experience in audit and compliance roles, with direct ownership of certification/attestation projects Have worked in cloud-native environments and understand security and privacy considerations for multi-cloud architectures Can translate complex compliance requirements into actionable workstreams for technical and non-technical stakeholders Have built common controls frameworks or GRC systems that scaled with organizational growth Write clear and useful security and privacy documentation for both external and internal audiences. Thrive in ambiguous, fast-paced environments where you'll need to build processes from scratch Are comfortable organizing time-bounded task management of delegated work streams across a diverse organization Are energized by being the subject matter expert who educates the organization on new compliance requirements Strong candidates may also: Have worked in AI/ML companies and understand unique security considerations for model development and deployment Bring experience from high-growth technology companies managing rapid compliance expansion Have some experience implementing automated enforcement of security controls (i.e., compliance as code) Possess relevant certifications (CISA, CRISC, CISM, CISSP, or ISO 27001 Lead Auditor/Implementer) Candidates need not have: Done everything on this list before—we value learning agility and willingness to tackle novel compliance challenges in the AI space Deadline to apply: None. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis. The expected base compensation for this position is below. Our total compensation package for full-time employees includes equity, benefits, and may include incentive compensation.Annual Salary:$270,000 - $345,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts.

We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco.

How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts.

We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco.

How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.

We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us.

How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

      "job_description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the role: We are looking for backend / platform software engineers to join our Product Foundations org. We build foundational primitives that help accelerate product development across Anthropic. Some examples of what we own and maintain are our core sampling pipeline, our rate limiting platform, and our RAG platform. We have multiple teams that are currently hiring. Team placement occurs after the interview process, taking into account your interests and experience alongside organizational needs. This flexible approach allows us to match talented engineers with the platform efforts where they'll have the greatest impact and growth potential: Product Dev Product: We work on maximizing the developer productivity of product engineers at Anthropic. You'll architect and optimize the critical development infrastructure that powers our AI product development, including dev environments, developer tooling, and CI/CD pipelines. You’ll partner closely with product teams to understand their development workflow and eliminate friction points. Your work will have an extraordinary multiplier effect, enhancing productivity across our entire product organization and accelerating our mission. Product Platform: We provide a set of stable, powerful, and easy to use shared product capabilities leveraged by the Claude.ai, API and other internal product and research teams. You’ll work on our core platform components like rate limiting, LLM sampling and multimodal processing. Our mandate includes developing reusable components, improving system performance, and creating scalable abstractions that accelerate product development across the organization while maintaining high standards for reliability and security. Accounts Platform: We build and maintain the critical infrastructure that powers identity and authentication across Anthropic's product suite. We work closely with product teams, security, support, and trust & safety as customers. We create scalable solutions for user authentication, authorization, role-based access control, and single sign-on that form the backbone of our company's identity management operations. We maintain a user-centric approach, building reliable systems that our users and company can depend on as we tackle complex challenges at the intersection of security, scalability, and user experience. Billing Platform: We build and maintain the core billing platform that powers all of Anthropic’s products. You will lead the design and implementation of our billing infrastructure, working at the intersection of our core product, financial systems, and customer-facing features. This role is crucial for scaling our revenue operations, ensuring a seamless customer experience and enables the launch of new and innovative products with complex billing requirements. Claude Execution: We build the infrastructure that enables Claude to safely interact with the outside world through the use of tools. Our team owns the platform that provides secure, isolated execution environments as well as the infrastructure that connects Claude to external services via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). You'll work on challenging problems at the intersection of security and capability: designing sandboxes that are both secure and performant, building reliable MCP infrastructure, and expanding our platform for enterprise deployments. We collaborate closely with product teams across Claude.ai, API, and Claude Code to deliver the execution capabilities that make Claude genuinely useful for real-world tasks. Relevant experience includes containerization, secure execution environments, and developing for enterprise requirements. Responsibilities: Build and scale platform components to handle Anthropic’s rapid growth Design and architect platform components that are composable and deliver value for a variety of use cases Collaborate closely with product teams to understand their needs and build platform capabilities that accelerate their feature delivery Make build vs buy decisions, evaluating and implementing 3rd party solutions when most impactful Set technical direction and vision for various product and platform features Partner with research to quickly prototype and launch new capabilities based on research breakthroughs You might be a good fit if you: Have 6+ years of practical experience as a backend or platform engineer building scalable distributed systems Have strong coding skills and experience with service-oriented architectures Have worked in early start-up or otherwise fast moving, rapidly evolving environments, and have ideally built products from 0 to 1 Take full ownership of your work, navigate ambiguity effectively, and proactively overcome obstacles to deliver results Are comfortable diving into any part of the system, whether it's infrastructure, services, or product frontends, to deliver effective solutions Enjoy working with a fast-paced team tackling cutting-edge problems in AI safety and conversational AI Take a product-focused approach and care about building solutions that are robust, scalable, and easy to use Enjoy pair programming (we love to pair!) Have a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Software Engineering or comparable experience Strong candidates may also: Have worked with NLP and ML models and understand their capabilities and limitations Have experience with REST APIs Have experience with React and Frontend frameworks The expected base compensation for this position is below. Our total compensation package for full-time employees includes equity, benefits, and may include incentive compensation.Annual Salary:$320,000 - $405,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day.

At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco.
