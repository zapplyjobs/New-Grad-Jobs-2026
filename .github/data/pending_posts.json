      "job_description": "Discord is used by over 200 million people every month for many different reasons, but there’s one thing that nearly everyone does on our platform: play video games. Over 90% of our users play games, spending a combined 1.5 billion hours playing thousands of unique titles on Discord each month. Discord plays a uniquely important role in the future of gaming. We are focused on making it easier and more fun for people to talk and hang out before, during, and after playing games.We're looking for a Product Designer to join our Notifications squad and help us build the next generation of our notification experience. This is a high-impact role where your work will directly influence how millions of users stay connected to Discord every single day. The Notifications team sits within Growth at Discord. Our mission is simple but challenging: help Discord users stay connected to the conversations and communities they care about, even when they're away. Our Notifications team plays a critical role in that connection — helping users stay engaged with the conversations and communities they care about, even when they're away from Discord. We're evolving Discord's notification experience to be more intelligent, trusted, and effective. This means designing new ways to reach users at relevant moments, building systems that coordinate notification delivery thoughtfully, and giving users meaningful control over their experience. This is a high-velocity team tackling complex problems at the intersection of growth, user experience, and trust. Your work will directly impact how we grow Discord while protecting the experience that makes it special. What You'll Be Doing Own end-to-end initiatives across the full notification experience — from new notification types to settings redesigns to delivery optimizations across all platforms (iOS, Android, Desktop, Web) Design with high craft and velocity — creating production-ready specs and high-fidelity prototypes while knowing when to ship vs. polish Influence scope and strategy in partnership with your PM, engineering lead, and cross-functional teammates, balancing growth velocity with user value Use data and research to inform decisions, partnering with research and data science teams to validate designs and understand user behavior Think in systems — considering how notification types, orchestration, and settings work together to create a cohesive experience Collaborate and communicate effectively — sharing work early and often, telling compelling stories about your design rationale, and building relationships across teams Drive projects autonomously — managing your own time and deliverables while knowing when to escalate blockers What you should have 3+ years of product design experience designing consumer-facing digital products — though we're open to strong candidates with 2+ years who demonstrate exceptional craft and potential. Strong visual design foundation with demonstrated aesthetic taste. You have a high level of skill crafting beautiful interfaces and an eye for creating delight in every product experience — typography, color, hierarchy, and composition are second nature to you. You're comfortable working with design systems. Solid interaction design skills — you create intuitive flows, understand information architecture, and can design for complex, multi-step experiences. You're comfortable designing systems, not just screens. High proficiency with Figma and prototyping tools (Protopie, Framer, Principle, etc.) — you use prototypes to communicate your vision, test concepts, and build alignment with stakeholders. Experience shipping products collaboratively in cross-functional teams with engineering, product management, research, and data science. Ownership mindset with a bias toward action — you proactively drive projects and decisions forward. You help guide product vision through design explorations, documentation, and presentations. Bonus Points: Personal use of Discord and passion for gaming or community platforms Experience designing growth, engagement, or lifecycle marketing products Understanding of notification systems, push delivery, or messaging platforms Familiarity with experimentation frameworks and data-driven iteration The US base salary range for this full-time position is $160,000 to $180,000 + equity + benefits. Our salary ranges are determined by role and level. Within the range, individual pay is determined by additional factors, including job-related skills, experience, and relevant education or training. Please note that the compensation details listed in US role postings reflect the base salary only, and do not include equity, or benefits.Why Discord? Discord plays a uniquely important role in the future of gaming. We're a multiplatform, multigenerational and multiplayer platform that helps people deepen their friendships around games and shared interests. We believe games give us a way to have fun with our favorite people, whether listening to music together or grinding in competitive matches for diamond rank. Join us in our mission! Your future is just a click away! Discord is committed to inclusion and providing reasonable accommodations during the interview process. We want you to feel set up for success, so if you are in need of reasonable accommodations, please let your recruiter know.
