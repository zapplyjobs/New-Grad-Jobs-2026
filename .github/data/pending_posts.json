Quinney College of Agriculture &amp; Natural Resources at Utah State University, is an energetic and rapidly expanding hub for Earth-science scholarship with 16 faculty and two lecturers. Our state-of-the-art infrastructure includes the Rock Deformation and Fault Mechanics laboratory, Luminescence Lab, light stable isotope and ICP-MS analytical suites, Mineral Microscopy and Spectroscopy Lab housing a Raman spectrometer, a field-emission scanning electron microscope in the Microscopy Core facility, and a micro-CT scanner. Within this framework, our Earthquake Science Group drives integrative research that spans fault rock characterization, laboratory friction experiments, remote sensing, seismology, numerical and data-driven modeling, and thermochronometry. This core focus on earthquake mechanics and hazard processes positions our department as a natural partner in seismic research and resilience efforts across Utah and beyond. Our department is well positioned to forge deep partnerships with the Utah Earthquake Engineering Research Center (UEEC) in Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering. The UEEC, launched in 2023 with a mission to advance Utah-specific seismic safety, retrofitting, and resilient infrastructure design, serves as a hub for engineering–geoscience integration.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The S.J. &amp; Jessie E. Quinney College of Agriculture &amp; Natural Resources provides a rich interdisciplinary environment, combining applied and fundamental perspectives on land, water, and environmental systems. The College has a historical legacy stretching back nearly a century and today offers a broad portfolio of graduate and undergraduate programs in areas such as geosciences, watershed sciences, ecology, soils, and environmental management. Because the geosciences faculty are embedded in this broader natural-resources context, there are strong avenues for crosscutting collaboration with adjacent units and allied centers.</p> <h2>University Highlights</h2> <p>Founded in 1888, Utah State University is Utah’s premier land-grant, public service university.
