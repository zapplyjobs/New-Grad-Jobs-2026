How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the Role Anthropic's national security policy team builds partnerships and programs with national security stakeholders in the U.S. and abroad that augment and support Anthropic’s mission, including efforts to ensure the U.S. and other democracies survive and thrive through the transition to transformative AI. As AI capabilities advance rapidly, policymakers and national security stakeholders need clear-eyed analysis of the global AI landscape—including the trajectories of major strategic competitors. The Geopolitics Analyst will build and maintain Anthropic's understanding of international AI developments. You'll track the full stack of AI competition—compute, energy, model capabilities, corporate strategies, capital flows, talent pipelines, adoption patterns, and government policy—and translate that analysis into actionable analysis for both internal strategy and external engagement. This role sits at the intersection of technology, business, and policy. You'll produce high-quality briefings for government stakeholders, inform Anthropic's policy positions, and help all internal and external stakeholders grasp how the international competitive landscape affects our mission. If you're energized by the idea of bringing rigorous analytical methods to one of the most consequential chapters of technology and human history, this role offers unique impact. Responsibilities Build and maintain systematic tracking of AI development in strategically significant regions, covering compute capacity, model releases, corporate funding, and policy developments Produce clear, well-sourced analytical products—ranging from quick-turn updates to in-depth assessments—for internal leadership and external stakeholders Develop and brief government officials, congressional staff, and national security community members on international AI competitive dynamics Monitor and analyze primary sources, including foreign-language technical publications, financial disclosures, and policy documents Identify emerging trends, capability shifts, and strategic inflection points that may affect US competitiveness or Anthropic's operating environment Collaborate with Anthropic's policy, communications, commercial, and technical teams to ensure our external engagement reflects accurate understanding of the global landscape Build relationships with external analysts, researchers, and government counterparts working on related issues You may be a good fit if you: Have demonstrated ability to conduct rigorous, independent, and clear analysis on complex, ambiguous topics with limited supervision Bring experience synthesizing large volumes of information into clear, decision-relevant products for senior audiences Can context-switch between deep technical research and polished executive communication Have a track record of producing high-quality written analysis under time pressure Are comfortable operating across sectors—engaging credibly with investors, technologists, and policymakers Care deeply about AI's impact on society and find Anthropic's mission compelling Have strong proficiency in Mandarin language industry and policy research methods, tools, and resources.

For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.Annual Salary:$265,000 - $295,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research.

      "job_description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About Horizons The Horizons team leads Anthropic's reinforcement learning (RL) research and development, playing a critical role in advancing our AI systems. We've contributed to every Claude release, with significant impact on the autonomy, coding, and reasoning capabilities of Anthropic's models. About the role We're hiring for the Cybersecurity RL team within Horizons. As a Research Engineer, you'll help to safely advance the capabilities of our models in secure coding, vulnerability remediation, and other areas of defensive cybersecurity. This role blends research and engineering, requiring you to both develop novel approaches and realize them in code. Your work will include designing and implementing RL environments, conducting experiments and evaluations, delivering your work into production training runs, and collaborating with other researchers, engineers, and cybersecurity specialists across and outside Anthropic. The role requires domain expertise in cybersecurity paired with interest or experience in training safe AI models. For example, you might be a white hat hacker who's curious about how LLMs could augment or transform your work, a security engineer interested in how AI could help harden systems at scale, or a detection and response professional wondering how models could enhance defensive workflows. You may be a good fit if you: Have experience in cybersecurity research. Have experience with machine learning. Have strong software engineering skills. Can balance research exploration with engineering implementation. Are passionate about AI's potential and committed to developing safe and beneficial systems. Strong candidates may also have: Professional experience in security engineering, fuzzing, detection and response, or other applied defensive work. Experience participating in or building CTF competitions and cyber ranges. Academic research experience in cybersecurity. Familiarity with RL techniques and environments. Familiarity with LLM training methodologies. The annual compensation range for this role is listed below. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.Annual Salary:$300,000 - $405,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

Navigate security and compliance requirements with patience and expertise Build and maintain accurate pipeline forecasting for complex, multi-workstream accounts. Develop deep understanding of how large security vendors budget for AI infrastructure across product and internal use cases Serve as the voice of the cybersecurity customer internally.

However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research.

Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

      "job_description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the Role Anthropic's sandboxing infrastructure enables Claude to safely execute code and interact with external systems. As we expand Claude's capabilities, the reliability, security, and developer experience of this infrastructure becomes increasingly critical. We're looking for an engineer to join the sandboxing team and help shape both the client-side library/API and the underlying infrastructure. In this role, you'll combine deep infrastructure expertise with an obsession for developer experience. You'll help maintain and evolve a system that must be correct, performant, and intuitive to use. You'll work closely with internal teams to understand their needs, burn down errors and edge cases, and build a roadmap that anticipates where the product needs to go. This is a role for someone who finds satisfaction in both the craft of building reliable systems and the empathy required to serve developers and researchers well. Responsibilities Contribute to the client library, API surface, and underlying infrastructure for Anthropic's sandboxing system, ensuring it is reliable, well-documented, and intuitive to use Drive down error rates and improve correctness through systematic debugging, monitoring, and proactive fixes Help develop and maintain a product roadmap for sandboxing capabilities, balancing immediate needs with long-term architectural improvements Partner closely with internal teams using the sandboxing system to understand their requirements, debug issues, and build tooling that serves their use cases Respond to incidents and production issues with urgency, conducting thorough root cause analysis and implementing preventive measures Build comprehensive testing, observability, and documentation to ensure the system meets a high quality bar Collaborate across the sandboxing team, flexing between client-side and infrastructure work as needed You May Be a Good Fit If You Have 5+ years of software engineering experience, with meaningful time spent maintaining libraries, SDKs, or developer-facing APIs Obsess over developer experience—you've thought deeply about API design, error propagation, documentation, and the small details that make a library feel well-crafted Have experience operating complex distributed systems Bring a track record of systematically improving reliability—you've burned down error budgets, built monitoring, and driven issues to resolution Can develop and articulate a long-term vision for a product, translating user feedback and technical constraints into a coherent roadmap Are comfortable with ambiguity and can context-switch between reactive incident work and proactive product development Communicate clearly with both technical and non-technical stakeholders Strong Candidates May Also Have Experience as a founder or early engineer at an infrastructure-focused startup, where you owned a product end-to-end Background in security, sandboxing, or isolation technologies (containers, VMs, seccomp, namespaces, etc.) Open-source contributions in the Python ecosystem Experience building developer tools, CLIs, or platforms used by other engineers History of working on incident response and on-call rotations for production systems Exposure to reinforcement learning or model training infrastructure Representative Projects These are examples of past work that would indicate a good fit—not a description of the role itself: Maintaining an open source SDK through multiple major version upgrades while minimizing breaking changes for users Leading an initiative to reduce P0 incidents by XX% through improved error handling, retries, and observability Building a developer platform at a startup from zero to product-market fit, iterating based on user feedback Embedding with an internal team for a quarter to deeply understand their workflows and shipping targeted improvements to a piece of infrastructure they rely on Developing a multi-quarter roadmap for a developer tools product, balancing user requests with technical debt reduction The annual compensation range for this role is listed below. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.Annual Salary:$300,000 - $405,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

      "job_description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the Role As Anthropic’s Head of Security Risk, you will own the strategy, execution, and continuous improvement of our security risk management program. Reporting to the Head of Security Risk & Compliance, you’ll build out a team of 4–6 risk engineers and serve as the central point for risk intake, triage, quantification, and assessment across the organization. You’ll work directly with company leadership to build a risk governance structure that brings clarity and discipline to how Anthropic identifies, evaluates, escalates, and treats its most important security risks. This role requires a genuine player-coach: someone who sets the vision and priorities for the risk function while personally diving into the most complex, novel, or high-stakes risk scenarios, particularly those at the frontier of AI risk where established frameworks don’t yet fully apply. You’ll oversee risk quantification processes including stress testing and scenario analysis, guide your team through structured risk assessments, and ensure that risk insights translate into actionable outcomes for engineering, product, and leadership audiences. Responsibilities: Own and steer Anthropic’s security risk management program end-to-end: risk intake, triage, assessment, quantification, treatment tracking, and reporting Manage and develop a small team of risk engineer, setting priorities, coaching on assessment methodology, and guiding the team through complex risk scenarios Design and operate the risk intake and triage process for ad hoc weaknesses, vulnerabilities, and risk submissions surfaced from across the company Partner with leadership to facilitate an enterprise forum for escalation, risk acceptance decisions, and strategic risk discussions Lead risk quantification efforts including stress testing, scenario modeling, and deep dives into novel risk areas, particularly AI-specific risks with limited precedent Oversee the execution of periodic and ad hoc security risk assessments across infrastructure, products, operations, and vendors Develop executive-level risk reporting and dashboards that give leadership clear visibility into top risks, trends, and program effectiveness Collaborate with various teams such as Engineering, Product, Compliance, Privacy, and Legal to ensure risk assessments reflect cross-functional perspectives and align with regulatory obligations (SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, EU AI Act, FedRAMP) Lead the response to newly identified enterprise-level security risks, coordinating rapid assessment and escalation when needed You may be a good fit if you: Have 15+ years of experience in security or risk management disciplines, with at least 5-7 years in a people leadership role managing risk engineers or equivalent Have built, transformed, or significantly scaled a security risk management program at a high-growth technology company Have hands-on experience with quantitative risk analysis—including FAIR, scenario modeling, Monte Carlo simulation, or similar approaches Excel at engaging executives on risk decisions, translating complex technical risk scenarios into clear business-relevant recommendations Have established risk governance structures (risk councils, steering committees, escalation frameworks) that earned leadership trust Are a genuine player-coach who leads from the front on the hardest problems while developing your team’s capabilities Can write precise, compelling risk statements that convey technical depth while remaining accessible to diverse stakeholders Strong candidates may: Bring deep expertise in risk assessment methodologies (NIST RMF, ISO 31000, FAIR, OCTAVE) and can adapt them to novel risk domains Have experience assessing AI-specific risks (model security, adversarial attacks, data pipeline integrity, prompt injection, training data provenance) Bring background in stress testing methodologies from financial services, critical infrastructure, or other high-stakes environments Have experience presenting to boards, executive risk committees, or senior leadership on enterprise risk posture Have experience with GRC platforms and risk management tooling (OneTrust, ServiceNow GRC, Archer, MetricStream, or similar) Deadline to apply: None, applications will be received on a rolling basis.The annual compensation range for this role is listed below. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.Annual Salary:$345,000 - $410,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

      "job_description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.Anthropic is seeking a Training Content and Systems Architect to build the systems and content that enable others to teach Claude effectively at scale. You'll own the single source of truth for trainer-facing materials and build AI-augmented processes that keep that content current, consistent, and high-quality across dozens of contexts simultaneously. This means designing content architectures that are modular enough for AI-assisted adaptation, building automated quality loops that flag drift or staleness, and creating tooling that lets a single educator operate at the output level that historically required a full enablement team. You'll also embed with internal teams and strategic partners to understand real trainer needs — then translate those needs into systems, not just slide decks. If you love the puzzle of making one person's work multiply through smart systems design, and you're excited about using AI not as a topic you teach but as the infrastructure through which you teach, this is the role. About Anthropic Anthropic is an AI safety and research company that's working to build reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our customers and for society as a whole. Our interdisciplinary team has experience across ML, physics, policy, business and product. Responsibilities: Maintain the single source of truth for all trainer-facing content — decks, speaker notes, facilitator guides, demo libraries, exercises — and build AI-augmented workflows for keeping it current as Claude's capabilities evolve Design modular content architectures that enable AI-assisted adaptation for different audiences, contexts, and locales without manual rework for each variant Create turnkey champion success packets that enable enterprise champions and partner trainers to run effective internal rollouts with minimal involvement from the education team Build automated quality and consistency checks — rubrics, spot-check processes, drift detection — that maintain Anthropic's standards as content flows through distributed training networks Embed with internal and partner enablement champions to understand what's working, what's missing, and what's changing, then systematize those insights into content updates Partner with our Certification Education Lead to ensure training content aligns with assessment and credentialing requirements Develop and track metrics on content adoption, trainer confidence, and downstream learner outcomes You may be a good fit if you have: 5+ years in enablement, train-the-trainer programs, or learning & development with a systems-building orientation — you think about how to make content maintainable and scalable, not just how to create it Experience creating training content for developers and other technical audiences Experience building and maintaining training content libraries at scale — specifically, building the systems that govern content, not just the content itself A working practice of using AI tools (Claude, LLMs broadly) as core infrastructure in your own workflows — you naturally reach for AI to solve operational and content problems rather than treating it as an occasional assistant Technical fluency sufficient to work confidently with APIs, SDKs, and code-based documentation; this isn't an engineering role, but you should be unintimidated by technical content and comfortable building light tooling or automations Strong instructional design instincts and a passion for continual improvement in how people learn Clear, structured thinking about how to make complex material accessible and how to make that accessibility repeatable Comfort operating in ambiguous, fast-moving environments where you'll build processes from scratch and design them to run with minimal human overhead Strong candidates may also have: Experience building AI-augmented content pipelines or using LLMs for content generation, review, or adaptation at scale Familiarity with LMS platforms, content management systems, or training infrastructure A track record of working cross-functionally with sales, customer success, and partner teams while maintaining an educator's perspective Prior work at a high-growth technology company navigating rapid product change Experience with certification programs or credentialing from the educational content side The annual compensation range for this role is listed below. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.Annual Salary:$1 - $2 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

      "job_description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the role We believe skill with AI is fundamental to human agency. Education Labs builds the paradigms that help people become genuinely more capable—not just more engaged. This is a new kind of role: part researcher, part product builder, part interaction designer. You'll be the second technical builder on a small team studying how AI transforms human capability—and shipping features based on what we discover. You'll have significant creative license to define what \"good\" looks like, exploring new interaction patterns rather than optimizing existing ones. We're skeptical of tutorials, onboarding flows, and engagement metrics. We care about experiences that make users progressively more capable, curious, and empowered over time. This means integrating skill development into product design, using Claude itself as a capability-building partner, and measuring success by how users actually grow. You'll operate as a one-person technical shop: prototyping new ideas, establishing technical direction, and shipping production-quality features to millions of users. You'll need strong product instincts and clean interface design sensibilities, balanced with comfort in ambiguity and frontier thinking. Responsibilities: Ship features that help users develop real skill with AI—measuring success by capability growth, not time-on-site Architect end-to-end prototypes (front-end and back-end) that test new interaction paradigms, with particular attention to the front-of-the-frontend: motion, polish, and interaction feel Define technical direction for the team—establish patterns others can follow Build relationships across Product, Design, and Research to influence how skill development principles shape Anthropic's broader product strategy Shape team strategy and roadmap—identify the highest-leverage opportunities and build conviction across stakeholders Translate research insights about skill development and human-AI collaboration into shipped product through close collaboration with researchers Document and share your work through clear writing, prototypes, and presentations that influence thinking across the organization You may be a good fit if you have: Strong full-stack engineering with design sensibility 6+ years building and shipping web products, with deep expertise across the stack Strong front-end craft: TypeScript/JavaScript, React, CSS—with an eye for interaction design, motion, and visual detail Solid back-end and data pipeline experience: Python, API design, analytics infrastructure A portfolio showcasing innovative interaction designs and high-quality implementations Track record of independently driving features from prototype to production Deep conviction about human capability Strong perspective on how technology should enhance human capabilities rather than diminish them Experience or genuine passion for skill development, HCI, developer tools, or products that help people become more capable Skepticism of purely engagement-driven metrics; interest in measuring capability outcomes Research mindset with product execution Comfort with ambiguity and exploring undefined problem spaces Ability to rapidly prototype, test with users, and iterate toward production Strong instincts for product design and user experience, even without formal design training Strategic leadership and coalition building Experience setting vision, shaping team strategy, and building conviction across cross-functional stakeholders Ability to build productive relationships with Product, Design, Research, and Engineering teams—especially when your team isn't the owner Strong sense of prioritization—knowing what to build now, what to defer, and what to cut Track record of influencing roadmaps and decisions beyond your immediate team Strong candidates may also have: Experience in developer tools, creative tools, learning platforms, or other products where user skill development and mastery matter more than time-on-site Background in learning sciences, cognitive science, HCI, skill acquisition research, or educational psychology (formal or self-directed) Experience with experimentation frameworks, A/B testing, or analytics that measure capability development in production Previous experience in research labs, frontier tech companies, or startups with high autonomy and ambiguity Published writing, talks, or open-source work on skill development, human-AI interaction, or product philosophy Experience building AI-native product experiences or working with LLMs in production contexts Strong candidates may also have Background in learning sciences, cognitive science, HCI, or educational psychology Experience in developer tools, creative tools, or learning platforms where mastery matters more than engagement Published writing, talks, or open-source work on skill development or human-AI interaction Experience building AI-native product experiences or working with LLMs in production What this role is not This is a hands-on technical role building product features, embedded within a research team. You'll provide technical guidance and help set direction, but this role doesn't involve people management off the bat. If you're looking to immediately transition into engineering management or lead a large team, this likely isn't the right fit. The annual compensation range for this role is listed below. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.Annual Salary:$1 - $2 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us.

How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts.

We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research.

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.AI-Driven Enablement / Full-Time / US OfficesAnthropic is seeking a Certification Content and Systems Architect to design and build the educational content and assessment components that power Anthropic's credentialing efforts. You'll own the substance of what certifications teach and measure: curriculum architecture, assessment design, competency frameworks, and the AI-native systems that let one educator maintain and evolve certification content across multiple programs simultaneously.You'll work closely with go-to-market and partnerships teams who define what certifications are needed and for whom. You own the educational design: what people need to know, how we assess whether they know it, and how we build those learning and assessment experiences to scale through intelligent tooling rather than growing headcount. The broader program strategy — audience planning, pricing, partner relationships — lives with other teams; you're the person who makes the education rigorous, current, and scalable.We're looking for someone who thinks about assessment from first principles — someone skeptical of multiple-choice exams as the default and excited about what becomes possible when AI can evaluate demonstrations of competence, generate adaptive assessments, and maintain item banks that evolve with the product. You should be as comfortable building the tooling and workflows around certification as you are designing the educational content itself.Responsibilities:Design certification curriculum architectures, assessment methodologies, and competency frameworks for product and technical knowledgeBuild AI-augmented assessment systems — item generation, adaptive testing, competency evaluation — that maintain rigor while scaling without proportional human effortDefine competency levels, learning progressions, and assessment rubrics for different certification tiers as defined by program stakeholdersCreate and maintain the educational content that feeds into certification programs, working with the Train-the-Trainer Lead to ensure alignment between training delivery and credentialing requirementsDevelop and maintain item banks, assessment instruments, and evaluation rubrics — and build AI-assisted processes for keeping these current as Claude's capabilities evolveCollaborate with GTM, Partnerships, and Customer Success when they identify certification needs — receiving their requirements around audience and business context, then owning the educational design and deliveryEstablish quality standards for certification assessments including validity, reliability, and fairnessAnalyze assessment data to continuously improve the learning experience and identify gaps in educational contentBuild operational tooling for certification administration, verification, and renewal on the educational sideYou may be a good fit if you have:5+ years in education, assessment design, credentialing, or developer education — with demonstrated experience designing how competence is measured, not just how content is deliveredA working practice of using AI tools as core infrastructure in your workflows — you naturally build AI into your processes for content generation, assessment creation, quality checking, and operational tasksTechnical fluency with Claude's products including the API, Claude Code, and Claude.ai — sufficient to design meaningful assessments of real competence with these toolsExperience with assessment methodologies beyond multiple-choice: performance-based assessment, portfolio evaluation, adaptive testing, or other approaches that measure applied skillStrong educational design instincts — you think in terms of learning progressions, competency frameworks, and what it actually means to \"know\" something versus having been exposed to itComfort operating in ambiguous, fast-moving environments and building from scratch — particularly building systems designed to run lean through intelligent automationClear, structured communication and the ability to work with non-education stakeholders (sales, partnerships) while maintaining an educator's standardsStrong candidates may also have:Experience building AI-augmented assessment systems or using LLMs for item generation, evaluation, or adaptive learningKnowledge of psychometrics, credential validation, or assessment quality frameworksExperience with non-traditional methods for tracking and assessing understandingBackground in developer education or technical credentialing specificallyFamiliarity with LMS platforms or certification delivery systemsPrior work at a high-growth technology company navigating rapid product changeThe annual compensation range for this role is listed below.

How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

Here’s what you’ll do (and we’ll support you so you’re great at it) Learn by doing: pair daily with engineers to design, code, test, and ship features safely and incrementally. Explain your thinking: talk through tradeoffs, ask clarifying questions, and make your reasoning visible in daily conversations, PRs, and design reviews. Practice feedback as a skill: give and receive actionable feedback, and iterate quickly with your mentor and teammates. Build breadth and depth: rotate pairing partners and tasks to expand your toolkit across frontend, backend, and tests. Grow your independence: progress from observer to driver to navigator with support, celebrating steady, compounding wins. Share outcomes: demo your work and reflect on what you learned as you move toward L1 readiness. Here’s what we’re looking for Creative thinkers who can frame a problem, test an approach, and explain their reasoning clearly. Curiosity and humility — you seek feedback, change your mind with new evidence, and keep going when it’s hard. Strong communication in a collaborative, pair‑heavy environment; you make teammates better. Evidence of learning and making — of any kind: you create things and can show your process (e.g., music, art, writing, community projects, physical builds, software experiments, or other self‑directed work). Comfort with the basics in at least one programming language and eagerness to learn the rest on the job. No specific degree or prior professional SWE experience is required.

In this hands-on technical role, you will partner closely with our software engineers and researchers to ensure that security is a core consideration from initial design through implementation. You will lead threat modeling and secure design reviews to proactively identify and mitigate risks early, and help with continuous risk assessment. You will build tools and systems to support developers shipping code securely, adhering to secure coding best practices. Your insights will shape our tooling, detection capabilities, and defenses against emerging threats to AI/ML. You'll develop the standards, processes, and educational resources that enable all Anthropic engineers to be security champions. This high-impact role demands a security practitioner who can think like an attacker, has a developer mindset, and can build strong relationships. Responsibilities: Help secure AI products and internal tools that are introducing industry-novel security risks and pushing established security boundaries Lead “shift left” security efforts to build security into the software development lifecycle. Conduct secure design reviews and threat modeling. Identify and prioritize risks, attack surfaces, and vulnerabilities. Develop tooling to scale security code reviews and respond to developer questions, including advising developers on remediating vulnerabilities and following secure coding practices.

Leverage creative and strategic thinking to reduce risk through secure design and simplicity, not just controls. Possess broad security knowledge to connect the dots across domains and identify holistic ways to decrease the overall threat surface. Are keen to distill complex security concepts into clear actions and drive consensus without direct authority. Embody a proactive mindset to thread security throughout the product lifecycle through activities like threat modeling, secure code review, and education. Have a strong grasp of offensive security to anticipate risks from an adversary's perspective, not just check compliance boxes. Bring experience with modern application stacks, infrastructure, and security tools to implement pragmatic defenses.

We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco.

      "job_description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the role As a Content Designer on the Enterprise Growth team, you'll shape how the world's most sophisticated organizations understand and adopt Claude. You'll work across product, marketing, and sales to design content experiences for enterprise decision-makers in finance, sales operations, and life sciences—industries where precision, trust, and compliance aren't negotiable. This role sits at the intersection of strategy and craft. You'll translate Claude's capabilities into value propositions that land differently for a CFO evaluating AI for financial analysis than for a pharma researcher assessing tools for literature review. You'll build the content foundations—voice, positioning, educational materials—that help enterprises trust AI in high-stakes contexts. And you'll execute across the full journey: thought leadership, sales enablement, product onboarding, and customer success. You'll also use Claude as a core part of how you work—writing, thinking, prototyping—and bring what you learn back into the content you create for customers. Responsibilities: Own content strategy for enterprise growth across finance, healthcare, and life sciences—shaping how regulated industries understand Claude's unique value proposition around capability, safety, and trust Use Claude extensively in your own work: writing, ideating, testing, and refining. Model the AI fluency we want to help enterprise customers build, and bring those insights back into the content you create Design whole content experiences. Prototype in Figma, collaborate closely with engineering, and be comfortable enough with code to understand how your content surfaces in the product Develop prompts, interaction patterns, and educational content that help enterprise users get value from Claude quickly—teaching people to think with AI, not just use it Add to our scalable content systems—agents, frameworks, tools—that maintain quality at velocity without becoming bottlenecks Design onboarding experiences and best practice guides that accelerate time-to-value Shape product experiences that feel native to enterprise contexts, collaborating cross-functionally to ensure terminology, flows, and interactions land with sophisticated buyers What we're looking for: 6+ years in content design, UX writing, or content strategy, with at least 3 years focused on B2B or enterprise products Genuine curiosity about AI and how it changes your craft. You use Claude (or other LLMs) in your actual work as a thinking partner. You have opinions about what outputs are good enough, where it falls short, and how to bridge that gap Comfort with code. You don't need to be an engineer, but you can read a codebase, ship small changes, and collaborate fluently with developers Strong prototyping instincts and fluency in Figma. You think in interactions Experience developing content for complex technical products and sophisticated buyers—fintech, dev tools, healthcare, or similar Understanding of enterprise buying journeys and the ability to craft content that works for end users, practitioners, and executives simultaneously Portfolio that shows strategic thinking, clear writing for technical audiences, and content that moved business metrics Track record of building from scratch. You've created content systems, not just inherited them. You're energized by ambiguity, not paralyzed by it Strong candidates may also have: Experience in regulated industries or with compliance-sensitive content Background in sales enablement or solutions marketing History of conducting user research and customer interviews to shape content strategy The annual compensation range for this role is listed below. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.Annual Salary:$260,000 - $305,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains.

If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research.

As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research.

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the role In the Product Designer, Claude Code role, you'll: Design for agentic workflows across surfaces. Own the experience of Claude Code across terminal, IDE extensions, web, and Slack. Design how Claude communicates progress, requests permissions, handles failures, and coordinates multi-step autonomous work. Invent new interaction patterns. Claude Code is intentionally low-level and unopinionated—a power tool for sophisticated users. Design conventions that respect developer expertise while making complex agentic behaviors feel intuitive and trustworthy. Prototype in code. This is a developer tool. You'll work directly with terminal interfaces, understand CLI constraints, and build functional prototypes. The best ideas will come from hands-on exploration, not just mockups. Ship fast and iterate. Claude Code moves quickly—new capabilities ship constantly as models improve. You'll need to design, test, and refine in tight cycles, often on critical-path work for major launches. Work fluidly across the team. Partner with engineering, research, and product without needing clear handoffs or defined lanes. Jump into problems wherever you're useful—whether that's pairing with an engineer on implementation details, exploring a new model capability with a researcher, or pressure-testing an idea with users directly. Raise the bar on craft. Obsess over the details that make power tools feel right: information density, speed, keyboard-first interaction, clear feedback loops, minimal friction. Why this role matters: Claude Code started as a research project and became one of Anthropic's most successful products, generating over $1B in annualized revenue within six months of launch. It redefined how developers work, and we're just getting started. This is genuinely new territory. We're designing the future of coding — Claude working autonomously on tasks, making decisions, asking for input when needed, and coordinating with humans throughout. The interaction patterns for this don't exist yet. We need to invent them. The product is expanding fast: from terminal to VS Code and JetBrains IDEs, to web, to Slack. Each surface brings new design challenges. And the underlying models keep getting more capable, which means the design problems keep evolving. We need designers who can move as fast as the technology—people who are excited by the ambiguity, not frustrated by it. You might be a great fit if: You live at the intersection of code and design. You genuinely enjoy developer tools and tinker with new things for fun. This role will shape how developers experience agentic coding—not just at Anthropic, but across the industry.. You're a tinkerer and explorer. You try new tools before anyone asks you to. You have opinions about terminal emulators and keyboard shortcuts. You're energized by where AI is headed—and want to be part of figuring out what comes next. Bonus points: Experience designing for command-line interfaces, IDEs or other dev tools Contributions to open source projects or developer tools Understanding of how LLMs work and their current capabilities/limitations A GitHub profile, personal site, or side projects that show what you build when no one's asking The annual compensation range for this role is listed below. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.Annual Salary:$260,000 - $305,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time.

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems. About the role: When you see what modern language models are capable of, do you wonder, \"How do these things work? How can we trust them?\" The Interpretability team at Anthropic is working to reverse-engineer how trained models work because we believe that a mechanistic understanding is the most robust way to make advanced systems safe. We’re looking for researchers and engineers to join our efforts. People mean many different things by \"interpretability\". We're focused on mechanistic interpretability, which aims to discover how neural network parameters map to meaningful algorithms. Some useful analogies might be to think of us as trying to do \"biology\" or \"neuroscience\" of neural networks using “microscopes” we build, or as treating neural networks as binary computer programs we're trying to \"reverse engineer\". A few places to learn more about our work and team at a high level are this introduction to Interpretability from our research lead, Chris Olah; a discussion of our work on the Hard Fork podcast produced by the New York Times, and this blog post (and accompanying video) sharing more about some of the engineering challenges we’d had to solve to get these results. Some of our team's notable publications include A Mathematical Framework for Transformer Circuits, In-context Learning and Induction Heads, Toy Models of Superposition, Scaling Monosemanticity, and our Circuits’ Methods and Biology papers. This work builds on ideas from members' work prior to Anthropic such as the original circuits thread, Multimodal Neurons, Activation Atlases, and Building Blocks. We aim to create a solid foundation for mechanistically understanding neural networks and making them safe (see our vision post). In the short term, we have focused on resolving the issue of \"superposition\" (see Toy Models of Superposition, Superposition, Memorization, and Double Descent, and our May 2023 update), which causes the computational units of the models, like neurons and attention heads, to be individually uninterpretable, and on finding ways to decompose models into more interpretable components. Our subsequent work found millions of features in Sonnet, one of our production language models, represents progress in this direction. In our most recent work, we develop methods that allow us to build circuits using features and use this circuits to understand the mechanisms associated with a model's computation and study specific examples of multi-hop reasoning, planning, and chain-of-thought faithfulness on Haiku 3.5, one of our production models.” This is a stepping stone towards our overall goal of mechanistically understanding neural networks. We often collaborate with teams across Anthropic, such as Alignment Science and Societal Impacts to use our work to make Anthropic’s models safer. We also have an Interpretability Architectures project that involves collaborating with Pretraining. Responsibilities: Implement and analyze research experiments, both quickly in toy scenarios and at scale in large models Set up and optimize research workflows to run efficiently and reliably at large scale Build tools and abstractions to support rapid pace of research experimentation Develop and improve tools and infrastructure to support other teams in using Interpretability’s work to improve model safety You may be a good fit if you: Have 5-10+ years of experience building software Are highly proficient in at least one programming language (e.g., Python, Rust, Go, Java) and productive with python Have some experience contributing to empirical AI research projects Have a strong ability to prioritize and direct effort toward the most impactful work and are comfortable operating with ambiguity and questioning assumptions. Prefer fast-moving collaborative projects to extensive solo efforts Want to learn more about machine learning research and its applications and collaborate closely with researchers Care about the societal impacts and ethics of your work Strong candidates may also have experience with: Designing a code base so that anyone can quickly code experiments, launch them, and analyze their results without hitting bugs Optimizing the performance of large-scale distributed systems Collaborating closely with researchers Language modeling with transformers GPUs or Pytorch Representative Projects: Building Garcon, a tool that allows researchers to easily access LLMs internals from a jupyter notebook Setting up and optimizing a pipeline to efficiently collect petabytes of transformer activations and shuffle them.

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the Role: Anthropic's ML Performance and Scaling team trains our production pretrained models, work that directly shapes the company's future and our mission to build safe, beneficial AI systems. As a Research Engineer on this team, you'll ensure our frontier models train reliably, efficiently, and at scale. This is demanding, high-impact work that requires both deep technical expertise and a genuine passion for the craft of large-scale ML systems. This role lives at the boundary between research and engineering. You'll work across our entire production training stack: performance optimization, hardware debugging, experimental design, and launch coordination. During launches, the team works in tight lockstep, responding to production issues that can't wait for tomorrow. Responsibilities: Own critical aspects of our production pretraining pipeline, including model operations, performance optimization, observability, and reliability Debug and resolve complex issues across the full stack—from hardware errors and networking to training dynamics and evaluation infrastructure Design and run experiments to improve training efficiency, reduce step time, increase uptime, and enhance model performance Respond to on-call incidents during model launches, diagnosing problems quickly and coordinating solutions across teams Build and maintain production logging, monitoring dashboards, and evaluation infrastructure Add new capabilities to the training codebase, such as long context support or novel architectures Collaborate closely with teammates across SF and London, as well as with Tokens, Architectures, and Systems teams Contribute to the team's institutional knowledge by documenting systems, debugging approaches, and lessons learned You May Be a Good Fit If You: Have hands-on experience training large language models, or deep expertise with JAX, TPU, PyTorch, or large-scale distributed systems Genuinely enjoy both research and engineering work—you'd describe your ideal split as roughly 50/50 rather than heavily weighted toward one or the other Are excited about being on-call for production systems, working long days during launches, and solving hard problems under pressure Thrive when working on whatever is most impactful, even if that changes day-to-day based on what the production model needs Excel at debugging complex, ambiguous problems across multiple layers of the stack Communicate clearly and collaborate effectively, especially when coordinating across time zones or during high-stress incidents Are passionate about the work itself and want to refine your craft as a research engineer Care about the societal impacts of AI and responsible scaling Strong Candidates May Also Have: Previous experience training LLM’s or working extensively with JAX/TPU, PyTorch, or other ML frameworks at scale Contributed to open-source LLM frameworks (e.g., open_lm, llm-foundry, mesh-transformer-jax) Published research on model training, scaling laws, or ML systems Experience with production ML systems, observability tools, or evaluation infrastructure Background as a systems engineer, quant, or in other roles requiring both technical depth and operational excellence What Makes This Role Unique: This is not a typical research engineering role. The work is highly operational—you'll be deeply involved in keeping our production models training smoothly, which means being responsive to incidents, flexible about priorities, and comfortable with uncertainty. During launches, the team often works extended hours and may need to respond to issues on evenings and weekends. However, this operational intensity comes with extraordinary learning opportunities. You'll gain hands-on experience with some of the largest, most sophisticated training runs in the industry. You'll work alongside world-class researchers and engineers, and the institutional knowledge you build will compound in ways that can't be easily transferred. For people who thrive on this type of work, it's uniquely rewarding. We're building a close-knit team of people who genuinely care about doing excellent work together. If you're someone who wants to be part of training the models that will define the future of AI—and you're excited about the full reality of what that entails—we'd love to hear from you.

As a Research Engineer on Alignment Science, you'll contribute to exploratory experimental research on AI safety, with a focus on risks from powerful future systems (like those we would designate as ASL-3 or ASL-4 under our Responsible Scaling Policy), often in collaboration with other teams including Interpretability, Fine-Tuning, and the Frontier Red Team. Our blog provides an overview of topics that the Alignment Science team is either currently exploring or has previously explored. Our current topics of focus include... Scalable Oversight: Developing techniques to keep highly capable models helpful and honest, even as they surpass human-level intelligence in various domains. AI Control: Creating methods to ensure advanced AI systems remain safe and harmless in unfamiliar or adversarial scenarios. Alignment Stress-testing: Creating model organisms of misalignment to improve our empirical understanding of how alignment failures might arise. Automated Alignment Research: Building and aligning a system that can speed up & improve alignment research. Alignment Assessments: Understanding and documenting the highest-stakes and most concerning emerging properties of models through pre-deployment alignment and welfare assessments (see our Claude 4 System Card), misalignment-risk safety cases, and coordination with third-party evaluators. Safeguards Research: Developing robust defenses against adversarial attacks, comprehensive evaluation frameworks for model safety, and automated systems to detect and mitigate potential risks before deployment. Model Welfare: Investigating and addressing potential model welfare, moral status, and related questions. See our program announcement and welfare assessment in the Claude 4 system card for more. Note: For this role, we conduct all interviews in Python and prefer candidates to be based in the Bay Area. Representative projects: Testing the robustness of our safety techniques by training language models to subvert our safety techniques, and seeing how effective they are at subverting our interventions. Run multi-agent reinforcement learning experiments to test out techniques like AI Debate. Build tooling to efficiently evaluate the effectiveness of novel LLM-generated jailbreaks. Write scripts and prompts to efficiently produce evaluation questions to test models’ reasoning abilities in safety-relevant contexts. Contribute ideas, figures, and writing to research papers, blog posts, and talks. Run experiments that feed into key AI safety efforts at Anthropic, like the design and implementation of our Responsible Scaling Policy.

      "job_description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the role: When you see what modern language models are capable of, do you wonder, \"How do these things work? How can we trust them?\" The Interpretability team at Anthropic is working to reverse-engineer how trained models work because we believe that a mechanistic understanding is the most robust way to make advanced systems safe. We’re looking for researchers and engineers to join our efforts. People mean many different things by \"interpretability\". We're focused on mechanistic interpretability, which aims to discover how neural network parameters map to meaningful algorithms. Some useful analogies might be to think of us as trying to do \"biology\" or \"neuroscience\" of neural networks using “microscopes” we build, or as treating neural networks as binary computer programs we're trying to \"reverse engineer\". A few places to learn more about our work and team at a high level are this introduction to Interpretability from our research lead, Chris Olah; a discussion of our work on the Hard Fork podcast produced by the New York Times, and this blog post (and accompanying video) sharing more about some of the engineering challenges we’d had to solve to get these results. Some of our team's notable publications include A Mathematical Framework for Transformer Circuits, In-context Learning and Induction Heads, Toy Models of Superposition, Scaling Monosemanticity, and our Circuits’ Methods and Biology papers. This work builds on ideas from members' work prior to Anthropic such as the original circuits thread, Multimodal Neurons, Activation Atlases, and Building Blocks. We aim to create a solid foundation for mechanistically understanding neural networks and making them safe (see our vision post). In the short term, we have focused on resolving the issue of \"superposition\" (see Toy Models of Superposition, Superposition, Memorization, and Double Descent, and our May 2023 update), which causes the computational units of the models, like neurons and attention heads, to be individually uninterpretable, and on finding ways to decompose models into more interpretable components. Our subsequent work found millions of features in Sonnet, one of our production language models, represents progress in this direction. In our most recent work, we develop methods that allow us to build circuits using features and use this circuits to understand the mechanisms associated with a model's computation and study specific examples of multi-hop reasoning, planning, and chain-of-thought faithfulness on Haiku 3.5, one of our production models.” This is a stepping stone towards our overall goal of mechanistically understanding neural networks. We often collaborate with teams across Anthropic, such as Alignment Science and Societal Impacts to use our work to make Anthropic’s models safer. We also have an Interpretability Architectures project that involves collaborating with Pretraining. Responsibilities: Develop methods for understanding LLMs by reverse engineering algorithms learned in their weights Design and run robust experiments, both quickly in toy scenarios and at scale in large models Create and analyze new interpretability features and circuits to better understand how models work. Build infrastructure for running experiments and visualizing results Work with colleagues to communicate results internally and publicly You may be a good fit if you: Have a strong track record of scientific research (in any field), and have done some work on Interpretability Enjoy team science – working collaboratively to make big discoveries Are comfortable with messy experimental science. We're inventing the field as we work, and the first textbook is years away You view research and engineering as two sides of the same coin. Every team member writes code, designs and runs experiments, and interprets results You can clearly articulate and discuss the motivations behind your work, and teach us about what you've learned. You like writing up and communicating your results, even when they're null To learn more about the skills we look for and how to prepare for this role, see our blog post – So You Want to Work in Mechanistic Interpretability?

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the Role We're looking for desktop app engineers to join our Claude product team and help build native applications that harness the transformative power of advanced language models. Your mission will be to package our AI capabilities into elegant desktop experiences that put unprecedented capabilities at users' fingertips. You will work with a talented team of engineers, researchers, and product specialists to design and implement key components that bridge our AI technology with intuitive user interfaces. Join us in this exciting mission to transform how people engage with our AI technology and unlock new realms of human potential. Today, our app is mostly web-based – but we’re eager to build the best possible version of Claude for macOS and Windows with a mix of both native and web technologies. You might be a great fit for this role if you’re up for the challenge of learning multiple programming languages. We are more interested in strong engineers excited to learn new languages and technologies to build the best possible experience than we are looking for people with hands-on experience in Chromium, Electron, C++, or the various native macOS and Windows APIs. We believe that strong engineers can learn whatever technology is best suited to build the best possible experience – and we understand that even the best engineers will have little experience with one of the operating systems and areas we’d like to invest in. We’re looking for curious engineers excited to figure out, with us, what AI on the desktop could do. Responsibilities: Develop and maintain the core infrastructure and features within Claude.ai and in our Electron-based desktop app using a typical web stack (TypeScript, React) Use native code (Rust, Swift, C++) to bring advanced features to the desktop app, connecting Claude to macOS and Windows Optimize application performance, memory usage, and startup time across platforms Design and build robust update mechanisms and deployment pipelines Create monitoring tools to track application performance and user experience Build a strong intuition for how advanced LLMs could be most useful on your computer, augmenting humans in their work You may be a good fit if you have: Have 5+ years of experience as a software engineer, with strong emphasis on desktop application development Have practical experience with Electron and deep understanding of its architecture Possess strong JavaScript/TypeScript skills and experience with modern frontend frameworks Take a product-focused approach and care about building solutions that are robust, scalable, and easy to use Have experience with native module development in C++ to extend application capabilities Understand macOS and/or Windows platform-specific technologies and development patterns Have experience with cross-platform application packaging, code signing, and distribution Thrive in a fast-paced, collaborative environment and enjoy working closely with cross-functional teams We’re working with a large number of technologies - and you might be an excellent candidate even if you’ve only worked with a subset of them. An ideal candidate may have never used Electron before but does have hands-on experience in working with Chromium’s C++. Similarly, a great candidate may have worked on Electron apps, but hasn’t used C++ or Swift before. We understand that even the best engineers will have more experience with some platforms than others. Strong candidates may also have experience with: Experience working on and building operating systems, browsers, or deeply OS-integrated software (screensharing, video-calling, game engines, etc) Experience integrating and working with AI/ML models and understanding their capabilities Demonstrated success implementing cross-platform development strategies Vision for the future of AI-powered desktop applications and a drive to make that vision a reality Have experience with IPC (Inter-Process Communication) and security in desktop applications Deadline to apply: None.

We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research.

Ophelia helps people end their opioid use and restore their quality of life with respect for their time and dignity. Our mission is to make evidence-based treatments for opioid use disorder (OUD) accessible to everyone... and we're looking to bring more people onto our team to help us achieve it. Ophelia is a venture-backed, healthcare startup that helps individuals with OUD by providing FDA-approved medication and clinical care through a telehealth platform.

Your work will have a direct impact on patients, clinicians, and our ability to scale. In this role, you'll work collaboratively through the full product cycle—from inception to results—taking responsibility for your tasks and, with mentorship and support, driving small projects to completion in our remote environment. You’ll collaborate deeply with Product and Design peers and cross-functional teams, including clinicians and non-technical stakeholders, to ensure our products meet the needs of both users and the business. Flexibility and adaptability will be key, as the product needs and company priorities shift rapidly in this fast-evolving, growth-stage company. Other responsibilities include continuously improving our systems through code reviews, debugging, refactoring, and system maintenance while advocating for best practices to maintain code quality and performance. Through code review and 1:1 sessions, you will be actively mentored by more senior engineers, and be coached on learning and professional development opportunities. Your role also involves staying up-to-date on emerging industry trends and technologies, including but not limited to the use of AI in our products and development processes, bringing new ideas to drive innovation in product design and development. Together, we will help hard-to-reach individuals treat their opioid dependence. While direct experience in this treatment area is not mandatory, knowledge of the healthcare space, including understanding health outcomes, benchmarks, systems, and regulatory compliance (HIPAA) is highly beneficial. Responsibilities Develop across the stack, with an emphasis on increasing capabilities of front-end apps, delivering impact by supporting team needs. Our core technologies are Typescript, React, and Firebase (e.g., Firestore, Authentication, Remote Config) in Google Cloud Platform. Take ownership of your work, with support, by driving small projects from inception to impact, while maintaining an emphasis on code quality. Proactive communication, inquisitiveness, collaboration, and relative autonomy are key in our remote environment. Practice flexibility and adaptability in our growth-stage company.

You’ll be encouraged to ask even “dumb” questions as you work directly with our technical and non-technical teams to build the next generation of our products. Improve quality continuously through healthy software development habits, asking questions, and communicating issues. Use code reviews, test coverage, quality assurance work, debugging, system maintenance, and refactoring as primary tools to enhance systems. Stay current with industry trends, emerging technologies (including AI tooling), and best practices to drive innovation and excellence in product design and implementation. Skills & Competencies 1+ years experience in engineering, with solid SDLC fundamentals and a strong appetite for learning. Experience at a growth-stage company is a plus. Strong foundational problem-solving skills for low- to moderate- complexity technical challenges and debugging issues across a full stack, cloud-based application.

Compensation is dynamic at Ophelia: as long as the company performs well and meets our targets, there will be opportunities for increased compensation annually.

      "job_description": "About Vercel: Vercel gives developers the tools and cloud infrastructure to build, scale, and secure a faster, more personalized web. As the team behind v0, Next.js, and AI SDK, Vercel helps customers like Ramp, Supreme, PayPal, and Under Armour build for the AI-native web. Our mission is to enable the world to ship the best products. That starts with creating a place where everyone can do their best work. Whether you're building on our platform, supporting our customers, or shaping our story: You can just ship things.About the role: We are looking for a Forward-Deployed Engineer to join our Professional Services team. This is not a traditional consulting role—you will embed directly with our most strategic enterprise customers to drive transformational outcomes across frontend modernization, platform migrations, and AI adoption. In this role, you will lead complex Next.js migrations, architect high-performance applications, and build production AI solutions—all within customer environments. You'll work hands-on-keyboard alongside customer teams, whether you're migrating a legacy React application to App Router, conducting a deep-dive code audit, or deploying production agents using Vercel's AI SDK. You will be equally comfortable leading a technical discovery session with engineering leadership as you are refactoring a complex rendering strategy or optimizing an agentic workflow. Our Forward-Deployed Engineer operate with high agency and autonomy. You'll navigate ambiguous enterprise environments, assess technical debt, design migration strategies, and deliver measurable business value—all while building long-term relationships that expand our partnership with each customer. You will report to the Director of Professional Services and will be remote-first with significant travel (25-40%) to customer sites for embedded engagements. What you will do: Lead complex frontend migrations—modernizing legacy React, Vue, or other frameworks to Next.js, including Pages to App Router transitions, incremental adoption strategies, and large-scale codebase transformations. Conduct technical assessments and code audits, analyzing customer codebases for performance bottlenecks, architectural anti-patterns, and optimization opportunities—delivering actionable roadmaps that drive measurable improvements. Architect and implement high-performance Next.js applications, leveraging App Router, Server Components, streaming, ISR, edge functions, and advanced rendering strategies to meet enterprise scale and performance requirements. Optimize Core Web Vitals and application performance, using tools like Vercel Speed Insights to diagnose issues and implement fixes that improve SEO, conversion rates, and user experience. Build production AI solutions using Vercel's AI SDK and AI Cloud—including conversational interfaces, production agents, MCP servers, and agentic workflows that transform customer operations. Embed with strategic customers to build production applications—working within their systems, understanding their constraints, and shipping TypeScript code that goes live. Drive enablement and knowledge transfer through workshops, pair programming, and documentation—ensuring customer teams can extend and maintain solutions independently. Navigate complex enterprise environments by building relationships with stakeholders across engineering, product, and executive teams—translating technical capabilities into business outcomes. Participate in pre-sales activities by providing technical expertise during discovery calls, scoping sessions, and proposal development for migrations, audits, and AI transformation engagements. Contribute to our service evolution by identifying repeatable patterns, building reusable components, and sharing implementation insights back to Product and Engineering teams. About you: 5+ years of experience in software engineering with at least 2 years in a customer-facing technical role (consulting, solutions engineering, forward deployed engineering, or technical founder experience). Expert-level TypeScript skills—this is your primary language. You write production TypeScript daily and have strong opinions on type safety, patterns, and tooling. Deep expertise in Next.js, with a proven track record of architecting and delivering complex applications using App Router, Server Components, server-side rendering (SSR), static generation (SSG), incremental static regeneration (ISR), and edge functions. Demonstrated experience leading frontend migrations—you've modernized legacy applications to Next.js, navigated incremental adoption strategies, and understand the challenges of migrating large codebases in production environments. Mastery of React and its ecosystem, including advanced state management, performance optimization, and modern patterns like streaming, suspense, and concurrent features. Production experience with LLMs and AI applications, including prompt engineering, agent development, and tool use patterns. Familiarity with Vercel's AI SDK is strongly preferred. High agency with comfort in ambiguity—you thrive when given a problem to solve rather than a task to complete, and you can navigate complex organizations to drive outcomes. Exceptional communication skills with the ability to conduct technical discovery, present to executives, mentor engineers, and build lasting customer relationships—all with a low-ego, collaborative approach. Business acumen to understand customer objectives, translate technical capabilities into ROI, and identify expansion opportunities throughout engagement lifecycles. Willingness to travel 25-40% to customer sites for embedded work and relationship building. Bonus if you: Have led large-scale migrations from legacy frameworks (Create React App, Gatsby, custom webpack setups) to Next.js in enterprise environments. Have expertise in performance optimization and Core Web Vitals, with experience diagnosing and fixing LCP, CLS, and INP issues at scale. Have experience with Model Context Protocol (MCP), building MCP servers, or implementing complex tool-use patterns in production AI applications. Have led enterprise AI transformation initiatives, including building production agents that automated manual processes or replaced legacy systems. Have worked with micro-frontends, module federation, or multi-team frontend architectures. Have contributed to the Next.js, React, or AI SDK open-source projects, or maintain popular related libraries. Have experience with enterprise deployment patterns including security reviews, compliance requirements, and multi-region architectures. Have a background in financial services, healthcare, retail/e-commerce, or media—industries with complex frontend ecosystems and growing AI adoption. Have spoken at conferences or published thought leadership on frontend architecture, migrations, or AI applications. Benefits: Great compensation package and stock options. Inclusive Healthcare Package. Learn and Grow - we provide mentorship and send you to events that help you build your network and skills. Flexible Time Off - Flexible vacation policy with a recommended 4-weeks per year, and paid holidays. Remote Friendly - Work with teammates from different time zones across the globe. We will provide you the gear you need to do your role, and a WFH budget for you to outfit your space as needed. The San Francisco, CA base pay range for this role is $137,000.00 - $207,000.00. This salary range is an estimate. Actual salary will be based on job related skills, experience and location. Pay ranges outside San Francisco may be adjusted based on employee location. The total compensation package also includes benefits and equity-based compensation. Your recruiter can share more about the specific pay range for your location during the hiring process.
