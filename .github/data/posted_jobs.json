How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the Role Anthropic's national security policy team builds partnerships and programs with national security stakeholders in the U.S. and abroad that augment and support Anthropic’s mission, including efforts to ensure the U.S. and other democracies survive and thrive through the transition to transformative AI. As AI capabilities advance rapidly, policymakers and national security stakeholders need clear-eyed analysis of the global AI landscape—including the trajectories of major strategic competitors. The Geopolitics Analyst will build and maintain Anthropic's understanding of international AI developments. You'll track the full stack of AI competition—compute, energy, model capabilities, corporate strategies, capital flows, talent pipelines, adoption patterns, and government policy—and translate that analysis into actionable analysis for both internal strategy and external engagement. This role sits at the intersection of technology, business, and policy. You'll produce high-quality briefings for government stakeholders, inform Anthropic's policy positions, and help all internal and external stakeholders grasp how the international competitive landscape affects our mission. If you're energized by the idea of bringing rigorous analytical methods to one of the most consequential chapters of technology and human history, this role offers unique impact. Responsibilities Build and maintain systematic tracking of AI development in strategically significant regions, covering compute capacity, model releases, corporate funding, and policy developments Produce clear, well-sourced analytical products—ranging from quick-turn updates to in-depth assessments—for internal leadership and external stakeholders Develop and brief government officials, congressional staff, and national security community members on international AI competitive dynamics Monitor and analyze primary sources, including foreign-language technical publications, financial disclosures, and policy documents Identify emerging trends, capability shifts, and strategic inflection points that may affect US competitiveness or Anthropic's operating environment Collaborate with Anthropic's policy, communications, commercial, and technical teams to ensure our external engagement reflects accurate understanding of the global landscape Build relationships with external analysts, researchers, and government counterparts working on related issues You may be a good fit if you: Have demonstrated ability to conduct rigorous, independent, and clear analysis on complex, ambiguous topics with limited supervision Bring experience synthesizing large volumes of information into clear, decision-relevant products for senior audiences Can context-switch between deep technical research and polished executive communication Have a track record of producing high-quality written analysis under time pressure Are comfortable operating across sectors—engaging credibly with investors, technologists, and policymakers Care deeply about AI's impact on society and find Anthropic's mission compelling Have strong proficiency in Mandarin language industry and policy research methods, tools, and resources.

For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.Annual Salary:$265,000 - $295,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research.

      "job_description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About Horizons The Horizons team leads Anthropic's reinforcement learning (RL) research and development, playing a critical role in advancing our AI systems. We've contributed to every Claude release, with significant impact on the autonomy, coding, and reasoning capabilities of Anthropic's models. About the role We're hiring for the Cybersecurity RL team within Horizons. As a Research Engineer, you'll help to safely advance the capabilities of our models in secure coding, vulnerability remediation, and other areas of defensive cybersecurity. This role blends research and engineering, requiring you to both develop novel approaches and realize them in code. Your work will include designing and implementing RL environments, conducting experiments and evaluations, delivering your work into production training runs, and collaborating with other researchers, engineers, and cybersecurity specialists across and outside Anthropic. The role requires domain expertise in cybersecurity paired with interest or experience in training safe AI models. For example, you might be a white hat hacker who's curious about how LLMs could augment or transform your work, a security engineer interested in how AI could help harden systems at scale, or a detection and response professional wondering how models could enhance defensive workflows. You may be a good fit if you: Have experience in cybersecurity research. Have experience with machine learning. Have strong software engineering skills. Can balance research exploration with engineering implementation. Are passionate about AI's potential and committed to developing safe and beneficial systems. Strong candidates may also have: Professional experience in security engineering, fuzzing, detection and response, or other applied defensive work. Experience participating in or building CTF competitions and cyber ranges. Academic research experience in cybersecurity. Familiarity with RL techniques and environments. Familiarity with LLM training methodologies. The annual compensation range for this role is listed below. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.Annual Salary:$300,000 - $405,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

Navigate security and compliance requirements with patience and expertise Build and maintain accurate pipeline forecasting for complex, multi-workstream accounts. Develop deep understanding of how large security vendors budget for AI infrastructure across product and internal use cases Serve as the voice of the cybersecurity customer internally.

However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research.

Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

      "job_description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the Role Anthropic's sandboxing infrastructure enables Claude to safely execute code and interact with external systems. As we expand Claude's capabilities, the reliability, security, and developer experience of this infrastructure becomes increasingly critical. We're looking for an engineer to join the sandboxing team and help shape both the client-side library/API and the underlying infrastructure. In this role, you'll combine deep infrastructure expertise with an obsession for developer experience. You'll help maintain and evolve a system that must be correct, performant, and intuitive to use. You'll work closely with internal teams to understand their needs, burn down errors and edge cases, and build a roadmap that anticipates where the product needs to go. This is a role for someone who finds satisfaction in both the craft of building reliable systems and the empathy required to serve developers and researchers well. Responsibilities Contribute to the client library, API surface, and underlying infrastructure for Anthropic's sandboxing system, ensuring it is reliable, well-documented, and intuitive to use Drive down error rates and improve correctness through systematic debugging, monitoring, and proactive fixes Help develop and maintain a product roadmap for sandboxing capabilities, balancing immediate needs with long-term architectural improvements Partner closely with internal teams using the sandboxing system to understand their requirements, debug issues, and build tooling that serves their use cases Respond to incidents and production issues with urgency, conducting thorough root cause analysis and implementing preventive measures Build comprehensive testing, observability, and documentation to ensure the system meets a high quality bar Collaborate across the sandboxing team, flexing between client-side and infrastructure work as needed You May Be a Good Fit If You Have 5+ years of software engineering experience, with meaningful time spent maintaining libraries, SDKs, or developer-facing APIs Obsess over developer experience—you've thought deeply about API design, error propagation, documentation, and the small details that make a library feel well-crafted Have experience operating complex distributed systems Bring a track record of systematically improving reliability—you've burned down error budgets, built monitoring, and driven issues to resolution Can develop and articulate a long-term vision for a product, translating user feedback and technical constraints into a coherent roadmap Are comfortable with ambiguity and can context-switch between reactive incident work and proactive product development Communicate clearly with both technical and non-technical stakeholders Strong Candidates May Also Have Experience as a founder or early engineer at an infrastructure-focused startup, where you owned a product end-to-end Background in security, sandboxing, or isolation technologies (containers, VMs, seccomp, namespaces, etc.) Open-source contributions in the Python ecosystem Experience building developer tools, CLIs, or platforms used by other engineers History of working on incident response and on-call rotations for production systems Exposure to reinforcement learning or model training infrastructure Representative Projects These are examples of past work that would indicate a good fit—not a description of the role itself: Maintaining an open source SDK through multiple major version upgrades while minimizing breaking changes for users Leading an initiative to reduce P0 incidents by XX% through improved error handling, retries, and observability Building a developer platform at a startup from zero to product-market fit, iterating based on user feedback Embedding with an internal team for a quarter to deeply understand their workflows and shipping targeted improvements to a piece of infrastructure they rely on Developing a multi-quarter roadmap for a developer tools product, balancing user requests with technical debt reduction The annual compensation range for this role is listed below. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.Annual Salary:$300,000 - $405,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

      "job_description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the Role As Anthropic’s Head of Security Risk, you will own the strategy, execution, and continuous improvement of our security risk management program. Reporting to the Head of Security Risk & Compliance, you’ll build out a team of 4–6 risk engineers and serve as the central point for risk intake, triage, quantification, and assessment across the organization. You’ll work directly with company leadership to build a risk governance structure that brings clarity and discipline to how Anthropic identifies, evaluates, escalates, and treats its most important security risks. This role requires a genuine player-coach: someone who sets the vision and priorities for the risk function while personally diving into the most complex, novel, or high-stakes risk scenarios, particularly those at the frontier of AI risk where established frameworks don’t yet fully apply. You’ll oversee risk quantification processes including stress testing and scenario analysis, guide your team through structured risk assessments, and ensure that risk insights translate into actionable outcomes for engineering, product, and leadership audiences. Responsibilities: Own and steer Anthropic’s security risk management program end-to-end: risk intake, triage, assessment, quantification, treatment tracking, and reporting Manage and develop a small team of risk engineer, setting priorities, coaching on assessment methodology, and guiding the team through complex risk scenarios Design and operate the risk intake and triage process for ad hoc weaknesses, vulnerabilities, and risk submissions surfaced from across the company Partner with leadership to facilitate an enterprise forum for escalation, risk acceptance decisions, and strategic risk discussions Lead risk quantification efforts including stress testing, scenario modeling, and deep dives into novel risk areas, particularly AI-specific risks with limited precedent Oversee the execution of periodic and ad hoc security risk assessments across infrastructure, products, operations, and vendors Develop executive-level risk reporting and dashboards that give leadership clear visibility into top risks, trends, and program effectiveness Collaborate with various teams such as Engineering, Product, Compliance, Privacy, and Legal to ensure risk assessments reflect cross-functional perspectives and align with regulatory obligations (SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, EU AI Act, FedRAMP) Lead the response to newly identified enterprise-level security risks, coordinating rapid assessment and escalation when needed You may be a good fit if you: Have 15+ years of experience in security or risk management disciplines, with at least 5-7 years in a people leadership role managing risk engineers or equivalent Have built, transformed, or significantly scaled a security risk management program at a high-growth technology company Have hands-on experience with quantitative risk analysis—including FAIR, scenario modeling, Monte Carlo simulation, or similar approaches Excel at engaging executives on risk decisions, translating complex technical risk scenarios into clear business-relevant recommendations Have established risk governance structures (risk councils, steering committees, escalation frameworks) that earned leadership trust Are a genuine player-coach who leads from the front on the hardest problems while developing your team’s capabilities Can write precise, compelling risk statements that convey technical depth while remaining accessible to diverse stakeholders Strong candidates may: Bring deep expertise in risk assessment methodologies (NIST RMF, ISO 31000, FAIR, OCTAVE) and can adapt them to novel risk domains Have experience assessing AI-specific risks (model security, adversarial attacks, data pipeline integrity, prompt injection, training data provenance) Bring background in stress testing methodologies from financial services, critical infrastructure, or other high-stakes environments Have experience presenting to boards, executive risk committees, or senior leadership on enterprise risk posture Have experience with GRC platforms and risk management tooling (OneTrust, ServiceNow GRC, Archer, MetricStream, or similar) Deadline to apply: None, applications will be received on a rolling basis.The annual compensation range for this role is listed below. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.Annual Salary:$345,000 - $410,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

      "job_description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.Anthropic is seeking a Training Content and Systems Architect to build the systems and content that enable others to teach Claude effectively at scale. You'll own the single source of truth for trainer-facing materials and build AI-augmented processes that keep that content current, consistent, and high-quality across dozens of contexts simultaneously. This means designing content architectures that are modular enough for AI-assisted adaptation, building automated quality loops that flag drift or staleness, and creating tooling that lets a single educator operate at the output level that historically required a full enablement team. You'll also embed with internal teams and strategic partners to understand real trainer needs — then translate those needs into systems, not just slide decks. If you love the puzzle of making one person's work multiply through smart systems design, and you're excited about using AI not as a topic you teach but as the infrastructure through which you teach, this is the role. About Anthropic Anthropic is an AI safety and research company that's working to build reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our customers and for society as a whole. Our interdisciplinary team has experience across ML, physics, policy, business and product. Responsibilities: Maintain the single source of truth for all trainer-facing content — decks, speaker notes, facilitator guides, demo libraries, exercises — and build AI-augmented workflows for keeping it current as Claude's capabilities evolve Design modular content architectures that enable AI-assisted adaptation for different audiences, contexts, and locales without manual rework for each variant Create turnkey champion success packets that enable enterprise champions and partner trainers to run effective internal rollouts with minimal involvement from the education team Build automated quality and consistency checks — rubrics, spot-check processes, drift detection — that maintain Anthropic's standards as content flows through distributed training networks Embed with internal and partner enablement champions to understand what's working, what's missing, and what's changing, then systematize those insights into content updates Partner with our Certification Education Lead to ensure training content aligns with assessment and credentialing requirements Develop and track metrics on content adoption, trainer confidence, and downstream learner outcomes You may be a good fit if you have: 5+ years in enablement, train-the-trainer programs, or learning & development with a systems-building orientation — you think about how to make content maintainable and scalable, not just how to create it Experience creating training content for developers and other technical audiences Experience building and maintaining training content libraries at scale — specifically, building the systems that govern content, not just the content itself A working practice of using AI tools (Claude, LLMs broadly) as core infrastructure in your own workflows — you naturally reach for AI to solve operational and content problems rather than treating it as an occasional assistant Technical fluency sufficient to work confidently with APIs, SDKs, and code-based documentation; this isn't an engineering role, but you should be unintimidated by technical content and comfortable building light tooling or automations Strong instructional design instincts and a passion for continual improvement in how people learn Clear, structured thinking about how to make complex material accessible and how to make that accessibility repeatable Comfort operating in ambiguous, fast-moving environments where you'll build processes from scratch and design them to run with minimal human overhead Strong candidates may also have: Experience building AI-augmented content pipelines or using LLMs for content generation, review, or adaptation at scale Familiarity with LMS platforms, content management systems, or training infrastructure A track record of working cross-functionally with sales, customer success, and partner teams while maintaining an educator's perspective Prior work at a high-growth technology company navigating rapid product change Experience with certification programs or credentialing from the educational content side The annual compensation range for this role is listed below. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.Annual Salary:$1 - $2 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

      "job_description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the role We believe skill with AI is fundamental to human agency. Education Labs builds the paradigms that help people become genuinely more capable—not just more engaged. This is a new kind of role: part researcher, part product builder, part interaction designer. You'll be the second technical builder on a small team studying how AI transforms human capability—and shipping features based on what we discover. You'll have significant creative license to define what \"good\" looks like, exploring new interaction patterns rather than optimizing existing ones. We're skeptical of tutorials, onboarding flows, and engagement metrics. We care about experiences that make users progressively more capable, curious, and empowered over time. This means integrating skill development into product design, using Claude itself as a capability-building partner, and measuring success by how users actually grow. You'll operate as a one-person technical shop: prototyping new ideas, establishing technical direction, and shipping production-quality features to millions of users. You'll need strong product instincts and clean interface design sensibilities, balanced with comfort in ambiguity and frontier thinking. Responsibilities: Ship features that help users develop real skill with AI—measuring success by capability growth, not time-on-site Architect end-to-end prototypes (front-end and back-end) that test new interaction paradigms, with particular attention to the front-of-the-frontend: motion, polish, and interaction feel Define technical direction for the team—establish patterns others can follow Build relationships across Product, Design, and Research to influence how skill development principles shape Anthropic's broader product strategy Shape team strategy and roadmap—identify the highest-leverage opportunities and build conviction across stakeholders Translate research insights about skill development and human-AI collaboration into shipped product through close collaboration with researchers Document and share your work through clear writing, prototypes, and presentations that influence thinking across the organization You may be a good fit if you have: Strong full-stack engineering with design sensibility 6+ years building and shipping web products, with deep expertise across the stack Strong front-end craft: TypeScript/JavaScript, React, CSS—with an eye for interaction design, motion, and visual detail Solid back-end and data pipeline experience: Python, API design, analytics infrastructure A portfolio showcasing innovative interaction designs and high-quality implementations Track record of independently driving features from prototype to production Deep conviction about human capability Strong perspective on how technology should enhance human capabilities rather than diminish them Experience or genuine passion for skill development, HCI, developer tools, or products that help people become more capable Skepticism of purely engagement-driven metrics; interest in measuring capability outcomes Research mindset with product execution Comfort with ambiguity and exploring undefined problem spaces Ability to rapidly prototype, test with users, and iterate toward production Strong instincts for product design and user experience, even without formal design training Strategic leadership and coalition building Experience setting vision, shaping team strategy, and building conviction across cross-functional stakeholders Ability to build productive relationships with Product, Design, Research, and Engineering teams—especially when your team isn't the owner Strong sense of prioritization—knowing what to build now, what to defer, and what to cut Track record of influencing roadmaps and decisions beyond your immediate team Strong candidates may also have: Experience in developer tools, creative tools, learning platforms, or other products where user skill development and mastery matter more than time-on-site Background in learning sciences, cognitive science, HCI, skill acquisition research, or educational psychology (formal or self-directed) Experience with experimentation frameworks, A/B testing, or analytics that measure capability development in production Previous experience in research labs, frontier tech companies, or startups with high autonomy and ambiguity Published writing, talks, or open-source work on skill development, human-AI interaction, or product philosophy Experience building AI-native product experiences or working with LLMs in production contexts Strong candidates may also have Background in learning sciences, cognitive science, HCI, or educational psychology Experience in developer tools, creative tools, or learning platforms where mastery matters more than engagement Published writing, talks, or open-source work on skill development or human-AI interaction Experience building AI-native product experiences or working with LLMs in production What this role is not This is a hands-on technical role building product features, embedded within a research team. You'll provide technical guidance and help set direction, but this role doesn't involve people management off the bat. If you're looking to immediately transition into engineering management or lead a large team, this likely isn't the right fit. The annual compensation range for this role is listed below. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.Annual Salary:$1 - $2 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us.

How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts.

We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research.

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.AI-Driven Enablement / Full-Time / US OfficesAnthropic is seeking a Certification Content and Systems Architect to design and build the educational content and assessment components that power Anthropic's credentialing efforts. You'll own the substance of what certifications teach and measure: curriculum architecture, assessment design, competency frameworks, and the AI-native systems that let one educator maintain and evolve certification content across multiple programs simultaneously.You'll work closely with go-to-market and partnerships teams who define what certifications are needed and for whom. You own the educational design: what people need to know, how we assess whether they know it, and how we build those learning and assessment experiences to scale through intelligent tooling rather than growing headcount. The broader program strategy — audience planning, pricing, partner relationships — lives with other teams; you're the person who makes the education rigorous, current, and scalable.We're looking for someone who thinks about assessment from first principles — someone skeptical of multiple-choice exams as the default and excited about what becomes possible when AI can evaluate demonstrations of competence, generate adaptive assessments, and maintain item banks that evolve with the product. You should be as comfortable building the tooling and workflows around certification as you are designing the educational content itself.Responsibilities:Design certification curriculum architectures, assessment methodologies, and competency frameworks for product and technical knowledgeBuild AI-augmented assessment systems — item generation, adaptive testing, competency evaluation — that maintain rigor while scaling without proportional human effortDefine competency levels, learning progressions, and assessment rubrics for different certification tiers as defined by program stakeholdersCreate and maintain the educational content that feeds into certification programs, working with the Train-the-Trainer Lead to ensure alignment between training delivery and credentialing requirementsDevelop and maintain item banks, assessment instruments, and evaluation rubrics — and build AI-assisted processes for keeping these current as Claude's capabilities evolveCollaborate with GTM, Partnerships, and Customer Success when they identify certification needs — receiving their requirements around audience and business context, then owning the educational design and deliveryEstablish quality standards for certification assessments including validity, reliability, and fairnessAnalyze assessment data to continuously improve the learning experience and identify gaps in educational contentBuild operational tooling for certification administration, verification, and renewal on the educational sideYou may be a good fit if you have:5+ years in education, assessment design, credentialing, or developer education — with demonstrated experience designing how competence is measured, not just how content is deliveredA working practice of using AI tools as core infrastructure in your workflows — you naturally build AI into your processes for content generation, assessment creation, quality checking, and operational tasksTechnical fluency with Claude's products including the API, Claude Code, and Claude.ai — sufficient to design meaningful assessments of real competence with these toolsExperience with assessment methodologies beyond multiple-choice: performance-based assessment, portfolio evaluation, adaptive testing, or other approaches that measure applied skillStrong educational design instincts — you think in terms of learning progressions, competency frameworks, and what it actually means to \"know\" something versus having been exposed to itComfort operating in ambiguous, fast-moving environments and building from scratch — particularly building systems designed to run lean through intelligent automationClear, structured communication and the ability to work with non-education stakeholders (sales, partnerships) while maintaining an educator's standardsStrong candidates may also have:Experience building AI-augmented assessment systems or using LLMs for item generation, evaluation, or adaptive learningKnowledge of psychometrics, credential validation, or assessment quality frameworksExperience with non-traditional methods for tracking and assessing understandingBackground in developer education or technical credentialing specificallyFamiliarity with LMS platforms or certification delivery systemsPrior work at a high-growth technology company navigating rapid product changeThe annual compensation range for this role is listed below.

How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

Here’s what you’ll do (and we’ll support you so you’re great at it) Learn by doing: pair daily with engineers to design, code, test, and ship features safely and incrementally. Explain your thinking: talk through tradeoffs, ask clarifying questions, and make your reasoning visible in daily conversations, PRs, and design reviews. Practice feedback as a skill: give and receive actionable feedback, and iterate quickly with your mentor and teammates. Build breadth and depth: rotate pairing partners and tasks to expand your toolkit across frontend, backend, and tests. Grow your independence: progress from observer to driver to navigator with support, celebrating steady, compounding wins. Share outcomes: demo your work and reflect on what you learned as you move toward L1 readiness. Here’s what we’re looking for Creative thinkers who can frame a problem, test an approach, and explain their reasoning clearly. Curiosity and humility — you seek feedback, change your mind with new evidence, and keep going when it’s hard. Strong communication in a collaborative, pair‑heavy environment; you make teammates better. Evidence of learning and making — of any kind: you create things and can show your process (e.g., music, art, writing, community projects, physical builds, software experiments, or other self‑directed work). Comfort with the basics in at least one programming language and eagerness to learn the rest on the job. No specific degree or prior professional SWE experience is required.

In this hands-on technical role, you will partner closely with our software engineers and researchers to ensure that security is a core consideration from initial design through implementation. You will lead threat modeling and secure design reviews to proactively identify and mitigate risks early, and help with continuous risk assessment. You will build tools and systems to support developers shipping code securely, adhering to secure coding best practices. Your insights will shape our tooling, detection capabilities, and defenses against emerging threats to AI/ML. You'll develop the standards, processes, and educational resources that enable all Anthropic engineers to be security champions. This high-impact role demands a security practitioner who can think like an attacker, has a developer mindset, and can build strong relationships. Responsibilities: Help secure AI products and internal tools that are introducing industry-novel security risks and pushing established security boundaries Lead “shift left” security efforts to build security into the software development lifecycle. Conduct secure design reviews and threat modeling. Identify and prioritize risks, attack surfaces, and vulnerabilities. Develop tooling to scale security code reviews and respond to developer questions, including advising developers on remediating vulnerabilities and following secure coding practices.

Leverage creative and strategic thinking to reduce risk through secure design and simplicity, not just controls. Possess broad security knowledge to connect the dots across domains and identify holistic ways to decrease the overall threat surface. Are keen to distill complex security concepts into clear actions and drive consensus without direct authority. Embody a proactive mindset to thread security throughout the product lifecycle through activities like threat modeling, secure code review, and education. Have a strong grasp of offensive security to anticipate risks from an adversary's perspective, not just check compliance boxes. Bring experience with modern application stacks, infrastructure, and security tools to implement pragmatic defenses.

We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco.

      "job_description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the role As a Content Designer on the Enterprise Growth team, you'll shape how the world's most sophisticated organizations understand and adopt Claude. You'll work across product, marketing, and sales to design content experiences for enterprise decision-makers in finance, sales operations, and life sciences—industries where precision, trust, and compliance aren't negotiable. This role sits at the intersection of strategy and craft. You'll translate Claude's capabilities into value propositions that land differently for a CFO evaluating AI for financial analysis than for a pharma researcher assessing tools for literature review. You'll build the content foundations—voice, positioning, educational materials—that help enterprises trust AI in high-stakes contexts. And you'll execute across the full journey: thought leadership, sales enablement, product onboarding, and customer success. You'll also use Claude as a core part of how you work—writing, thinking, prototyping—and bring what you learn back into the content you create for customers. Responsibilities: Own content strategy for enterprise growth across finance, healthcare, and life sciences—shaping how regulated industries understand Claude's unique value proposition around capability, safety, and trust Use Claude extensively in your own work: writing, ideating, testing, and refining. Model the AI fluency we want to help enterprise customers build, and bring those insights back into the content you create Design whole content experiences. Prototype in Figma, collaborate closely with engineering, and be comfortable enough with code to understand how your content surfaces in the product Develop prompts, interaction patterns, and educational content that help enterprise users get value from Claude quickly—teaching people to think with AI, not just use it Add to our scalable content systems—agents, frameworks, tools—that maintain quality at velocity without becoming bottlenecks Design onboarding experiences and best practice guides that accelerate time-to-value Shape product experiences that feel native to enterprise contexts, collaborating cross-functionally to ensure terminology, flows, and interactions land with sophisticated buyers What we're looking for: 6+ years in content design, UX writing, or content strategy, with at least 3 years focused on B2B or enterprise products Genuine curiosity about AI and how it changes your craft. You use Claude (or other LLMs) in your actual work as a thinking partner. You have opinions about what outputs are good enough, where it falls short, and how to bridge that gap Comfort with code. You don't need to be an engineer, but you can read a codebase, ship small changes, and collaborate fluently with developers Strong prototyping instincts and fluency in Figma. You think in interactions Experience developing content for complex technical products and sophisticated buyers—fintech, dev tools, healthcare, or similar Understanding of enterprise buying journeys and the ability to craft content that works for end users, practitioners, and executives simultaneously Portfolio that shows strategic thinking, clear writing for technical audiences, and content that moved business metrics Track record of building from scratch. You've created content systems, not just inherited them. You're energized by ambiguity, not paralyzed by it Strong candidates may also have: Experience in regulated industries or with compliance-sensitive content Background in sales enablement or solutions marketing History of conducting user research and customer interviews to shape content strategy The annual compensation range for this role is listed below. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.Annual Salary:$260,000 - $305,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains.

If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research.

How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research.
