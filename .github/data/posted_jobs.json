How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the Role Anthropic's national security policy team builds partnerships and programs with national security stakeholders in the U.S. and abroad that augment and support Anthropic’s mission, including efforts to ensure the U.S. and other democracies survive and thrive through the transition to transformative AI. As AI capabilities advance rapidly, policymakers and national security stakeholders need clear-eyed analysis of the global AI landscape—including the trajectories of major strategic competitors. The Geopolitics Analyst will build and maintain Anthropic's understanding of international AI developments. You'll track the full stack of AI competition—compute, energy, model capabilities, corporate strategies, capital flows, talent pipelines, adoption patterns, and government policy—and translate that analysis into actionable analysis for both internal strategy and external engagement. This role sits at the intersection of technology, business, and policy. You'll produce high-quality briefings for government stakeholders, inform Anthropic's policy positions, and help all internal and external stakeholders grasp how the international competitive landscape affects our mission. If you're energized by the idea of bringing rigorous analytical methods to one of the most consequential chapters of technology and human history, this role offers unique impact. Responsibilities Build and maintain systematic tracking of AI development in strategically significant regions, covering compute capacity, model releases, corporate funding, and policy developments Produce clear, well-sourced analytical products—ranging from quick-turn updates to in-depth assessments—for internal leadership and external stakeholders Develop and brief government officials, congressional staff, and national security community members on international AI competitive dynamics Monitor and analyze primary sources, including foreign-language technical publications, financial disclosures, and policy documents Identify emerging trends, capability shifts, and strategic inflection points that may affect US competitiveness or Anthropic's operating environment Collaborate with Anthropic's policy, communications, commercial, and technical teams to ensure our external engagement reflects accurate understanding of the global landscape Build relationships with external analysts, researchers, and government counterparts working on related issues You may be a good fit if you: Have demonstrated ability to conduct rigorous, independent, and clear analysis on complex, ambiguous topics with limited supervision Bring experience synthesizing large volumes of information into clear, decision-relevant products for senior audiences Can context-switch between deep technical research and polished executive communication Have a track record of producing high-quality written analysis under time pressure Are comfortable operating across sectors—engaging credibly with investors, technologists, and policymakers Care deeply about AI's impact on society and find Anthropic's mission compelling Have strong proficiency in Mandarin language industry and policy research methods, tools, and resources.

For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.Annual Salary:$265,000 - $295,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research.
