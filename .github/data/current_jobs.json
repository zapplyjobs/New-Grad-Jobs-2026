    "job_description": "Position Summary...\n\nWhat you'll do...Cortex Team is Walmarts core A.I. conversational platform, powering the vision of delivering the worlds best personal assistants to Walmarts customers, accessible via natural voice commands, text messages, rich UI interactions, and a mix of all of the above via multi-modal experiences. We believeconversationsare a natural and powerful user interface for interacting with technology and enable a richer customer experiences both online and in-store. We are building and designing the next generation of Natural Language Understanding (NLU) services that other teams can easily integrate and leverage, and build rich experiences: from pure voice and text shopping assistants (Siri,Sparky), to customer care channels, to mobile apps with rich, intertwined, multi-modal interaction modes (Me@Walmart). Interested in diving in? We need solid engineers with the talent and expertise required to design, build, improve and evolve our capabilities in at least some of the following areas: Service oriented architecture in charge of exposing our NLU capabilities at scale, and enabling increasingly sophisticated model orchestration. Since the service takes in traffic for a large set of Walmart customers (that is 80% of American households!), you will get to solve non trivial challenges in terms of service scalability and availability. You will design and build the primitives to efficiently orchestrate model-serving microservices, taking into account their dependencies, and improving thecombinedlatency and robustness of such microservices (e.g. fan out in parallel to N services for a single request, and reply with whichever gives the fastest answer). You will also bake-in functionality which can drive improved machine learning modeling and experimental design, such as A/B testing. Model serving and operations There is a constant tension between model improvements (more computations) and model serving latency. So, we are always in a quest of crunching more numbers, while preserving our SLAs, and controlling the operational costs. You will guide our efforts to always find the best tradeoffs in terms of architecture, tooling (Tensorflow serving? / ONNYX? / Triton?) and infrastructure (CPU? / GPU?, GCP? / Azure?) for model serving based on the latest model developments and product requirements. In particular, you will drive principled and scientific load-testing efforts, to clearly identify the tradeoffs at hands, and tune/optimize the model-serving stack. If interested, you will also get some opportunity to work on prompt engineering and agentic systems. Tooling, infrastructure and pipelines for reproducible workflow and models, enabling rapid innovation across the entire product lifecycle.

This is a senior, platform-focused role where you will define the multi-quarter strategy and technical direction for how live media is ingested, classified, managed, shared, and integrated across the production and distribution ecosystem. Operating at the intersection of production workflows, platform architecture, and system integrations, you will lead complex initiatives to build scalable platforms that support real-time editorial and creative workflows, cross-team coordination, and downstream use cases across Content, Production, Ads, Marketing, and Live Streaming. You will work closely with engineering, data, and partner teams to standardize how live media moves through Netflix, ensuring assets are reliable, discoverable, and usable at scale, while making thoughtful long-term platform bets, navigating technical tradeoffs, and aligning diverse stakeholders around shared infrastructure.\n\nThis role is based in Los Angeles or Los Gatos (hybrid), or remotely from the West Coast. Regular monthly travel to Los Angeles and Los Gatos is expected to support in-person collaboration.\n\nWhat You Will Do\n• Own the product vision, strategy, and multi-year roadmap for live media management and integration platforms, aligning with Netflix’s broader live and sports objectives.\n• Lead deep discovery into how live production media is created, ingested, shared, and consumed across production, broadcast, and downstream teams.\n• Define scalable, standardized approaches to live media metadata, asset management, and system integrations.\n• Partner closely with engineering teams to design and evolve platforms that support real-time workflows, reliability, and global scale.\n• Drive initiatives that introduce automation and intelligent tooling to reduce manual work and improve operational efficiency across media workflows and regional teams.\n• Balance immediate partner needs with long-term platform investments, making thoughtful tradeoffs to maximize durability and impact.\n• Translate complex system interactions into clear product direction, requirements, and delivery plans.\n• Use data, operational insights, and partner feedback to measure success and guide iteration.\n• Build strong cross-functional relationships and operate with transparency, autonomy, and accountability.\n• Operate with true transparency and autonomy. Our culture is unique and is key to how we innovate.\n\nWhat We’re Looking For\n• 6+ years of Product Management experience, including ownership of large-scale platforms, integrations, or content/media management systems.\n• Proven ability to define product strategy and lead multi-quarter initiatives in highly technical, cross-functional environments.\n• Deep understanding of media management, asset workflows, or system integrations within live streaming, sports, or media ecosystems.\n• Strong technical fluency, with experience partnering closely with engineering teams on APIs, data models, and platform architecture.\n• Experience leveraging automation or AI-enabled capabilities to improve workflow efficiency and system reliability (deep ML expertise not required).\n• Exceptional communication and stakeholder management skills, with a track record of aligning diverse teams around shared infrastructure.\n• A self-directed leader who thrives in ambiguity and is motivated by building durable, foundational systems that enable others to move faster.\n\nGenerally, our compensation structure consists solely of an annual salary; we do not have bonuses. You choose each year how much of your compensation you want in salary versus stock options. To determine your personal top of market compensation, we rely on market indicators and consider your specific job family, background, skills, and experience to determine your compensation in the market range. The range for this role is $440,000.00 - $725,000.00.\n\nNetflix provides comprehensive benefits including Health Plans, Mental Health support, a 401(k) Retirement Plan with employer match, Stock Option Program, Disability Programs, Health Savings and Flexible Spending Accounts, Family-forming benefits, and Life and Serious Injury Benefits. We also offer paid leave of absence programs. Full-time hourly employees accrue 35 days annually for paid time off to be used for vacation, holidays, and sick paid time off.

Learn more here.\n\nInclusion is a Netflix value and we strive to host a meaningful interview experience for all candidates. If you want an accommodation/adjustment for a disability or any other reason during the hiring process, please send a request to your recruiting partner.\n\nWe are an equal-opportunity employer and celebrate diversity, recognizing that diversity builds stronger teams. We approach diversity and inclusion seriously and thoughtfully. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, ancestry, national origin, caste, sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity or expression, age, disability, medical condition, pregnancy, genetic makeup, marital status, or military service.",

We’re interdisciplinary thinkers leveraging diverse business backgrounds in engineering, education, management consulting, business operations (and more!) to define, manage and measure Datadog’s global go-to-market motion. We empower all of Datadog’s customer-facing teams with the right training, skills, and tools at the right time in order to maximize their ability to drive Datadog’s next phase of growth.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Opportunity:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At Datadog, the &lt;strong&gt;Enablement&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Systems Engineer&lt;/strong&gt; plays a critical role on the Enablement Operations team, supporting our global Go-to-Market (GTM) Enablement &amp;amp; Business Value function. This role is responsible for configuring, maintaining, and evolving our enablement systems and tool stack, with a strong focus on automation, scalability, and operational efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In this role, you will partner closely with GTM Enablement stakeholders, as well as Sales Operations, RevOps, Internal Analytics, IT, and Sales &amp;amp; Technical Solutions teams, to design and deliver scalable, system-driven solutions that reduce manual effort and accelerate enablement impact across Sales and Technical teams.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;At Datadog, we place value in our office culture - the relationships and collaboration it builds and the creativity it brings to the table. We operate as a hybrid workplace to ensure our Datadogs can create a work-life harmony that best fits them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you’ll do:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You will be responsible for scaling Sales and Technical Enablement through systems, automation, and AI-driven tooling—reducing manual effort, improving speed to impact, and increasing operational efficiency across Enablement teams.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Specifically, you will:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identify, design, and automate&lt;/strong&gt; manual, repetitive, and error-prone enablement workflows across Sales Enablement, Technical Enablement, and GTM teams&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build and own end-to-end automated workflows&lt;/strong&gt; across systems,alerts, integrations, and lifecycle automations&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design and implement AI-powered tooling&lt;/strong&gt; to support GTM teams (e.g., content discovery, learning reinforcement, deal support, coaching insights, enablement analytics)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Configure, administer, integrate, and onboard new enablement and GTM tools&lt;/strong&gt;, ensuring seamless adoption and measurable business impact&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Partner closely with Enablement, Sales Ops, RevOps, IT, Data, and Product teams to &lt;strong&gt;translate business workflows into scalable technical solutions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Act as a &lt;strong&gt;technical owner for enablement systems&lt;/strong&gt;, ensuring reliability, security, scalability, and ease of use&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduce technical debt&lt;/strong&gt; by modernizing legacy workflows, simplifying system sprawl, and proactively improving existing automations&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Establish best practices for &lt;strong&gt;documentation, testing, monitoring, and support&lt;/strong&gt; of enablement tooling&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Measure and communicate impact through metrics such as &lt;strong&gt;time saved, headcount avoided, adoption, and enablement effectiveness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Conduct ad-hoc GTM enablement owned systems reporting&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Complete data entry tasks (migrate records between systems, upload data, mass data changes via API or system upload)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Assist broader GTM Enablement team in content creation, configuration, net new use case builds leveraging toolstack&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who you are:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;BS or MS in Computer Science, Engineering, or a related technical field (or equivalent practical experience)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;2-3 years of experience building &lt;strong&gt;automation, internal tools, or workflow systems&lt;/strong&gt; in a production environment&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Strong programming skills in one or more of the following: &lt;strong&gt;Python, JavaScript, or similar languages&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Hands-on experience working with &lt;strong&gt;APIs, system integrations, and cross-platform workflows&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience with &lt;strong&gt;LMS, Sales Recording, or Enablement platforms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with &lt;strong&gt;automation platforms, low-code/no-code tools, or workflow orchestration frameworks&lt;/strong&gt; (e.g., Zapier, Workato)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience applying &lt;strong&gt;AI/ML or LLM-based tools&lt;/strong&gt; in practical business workflows (prompting, evaluation, guardrails, integration into systems)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Strong problem-solving skills and comfort working with &lt;strong&gt;ambiguous or loosely defined requirements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Strong communication skills. Ability to communicate technical concepts clearly to non-technical stakeholders and influence cross-functional partners&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Role Matters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This role is critical to scaling Enablement efficiently.

    "job_description": "Senior Manager, Product Manager-Data Products\n\nAt Capital One, we believe great products begin with a deep understanding of our customers. From our earliest days, we pioneered the use of predictive modeling to individually personalize credit card offers, turning the entire industry on its head. As we’ve grown bigger, we’ve found more and more ways to use technology and face-to-face conversations to understand the human problems associated with money and finances.\n\nIn the Consumer Bank, we’ve combined this human-centered approach with our heritage of data-driven decision making to design, build and test our way to truly enabling financial experiences. We’ve challenged ourselves to spend less time planning, more time doing, and, above all else, to see the world through the eyes of our customers as they work to understand and manage their money.\n\nAre you passionate about improving the way people interact with their money? Are you driven by the delight you bring to customers? Do you keep asking, “why,” until you hit the root? It’s common to fall in love with solutions, but have you ever fallen in love with the problem? Do you have an opinion on whether shipping is more important than perfection? Do you have a healthy dose of skepticism for the impossible? If you’re nodding your head, then we want you!\n\nAs a Product Manager focusing on Bank Modernization you will be reimagining our Consumer Bank to create game-changing customer experiences and business outcomes. You will build platforms and services that deliver real-time data at scale.

Jumpstarting a self-supporting community by sowing the right seeds, building the right tools, integrating the right off-the-shelf products and just plain elbow grease\n• Succeeding strategically. Solving the right problem and holding on the wrong one\n\nHere is what you will bring to the table:\n• Curious. You ask why, you explore, you're not afraid to blurt out your crazy idea, or follow an email chain for weeks to find someone with an answer\n• Do-er. You have a bias toward action, you try things, and sometimes you fail. You dug up a hidden feature in an API that let you do something really cool or introduced a new routine that broke down silos led to better decisions\n• Passionate. You care about growing others and bringing them together around what’s possible. You’ve started meetup groups or taught General Assembly courses because you love enabling others\n• Communicator. You can communicate complex ideas clearly, your team knows their priorities and why they’re doing what they’re doing. Maybe you’re an introvert, or maybe you’re an extrovert, but nobody accuses you of keeping them out of the loop\n• Wrangler. You’ve gotten back-end engineers to play nice with iOS developers, you can inspire an ETL developer to write creatively about her latest pipeline\n• Fearless. Big, undefined problems don't frighten you. You can work at a tiny crack until you've broken open the whole nut. You are comfortable saying no\n• Basic Qualifications:\n• At least 5 years of experience working in Product Management\n• Currently has, or is in the process of obtaining one of the following with an expectation that the required degree will be obtained on or before the scheduled start date:\n• A Bachelor's Degree in a quantitative field (Statistics, Economics, Operations Research, Analytics, Mathematics, Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Software Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Information Systems or a related quantitative field)\n• A Master's Degree in a quantitative field (Statistics, Economics, Operations Research, Analytics, Mathematics, Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Software Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Information Systems or a related quantitative field) or an MBA with a quantitative concentration\n\nPreferred Qualifications:\n• Experience translating business strategy and analysis into consumer facing digital products\n\n​\n\nAt this time, Capital One will not sponsor a new applicant for employment authorization for this position.\n\nThe minimum and maximum full-time annual salaries for this role are listed below, by location.

We believeconversationsare a natural and powerful user interface for interacting with technology and enable a richer customer experiences both online and in-store. We are building and designing the next generation of Natural Language Understanding (NLU) services that other teams can easily integrate and leverage, and build rich experiences: from pure voice and text shopping assistants (Siri,Sparky), to customer care channels, to mobile apps with rich, intertwined, multi-modal interaction modes (Me@Walmart). Interested in diving in? We need solid engineers with the talent and expertise required to design, build, improve and evolve our capabilities in at least some of the following areas: Service oriented architecture in charge of exposing our NLU capabilities at scale, and enabling increasingly sophisticated model orchestration. Since the service takes in traffic for a large set of Walmart customers (that is 80% of American households!), you will get to solve non trivial challenges in terms of service scalability and availability. You will design and build the primitives to efficiently orchestrate model-serving microservices, taking into account their dependencies, and improving thecombinedlatency and robustness of such microservices (e.g. fan out in parallel to N services for a single request, and reply with whichever gives the fastest answer). You will also bake-in functionality which can drive improved machine learning modeling and experimental design, such as A/B testing. Model serving and operations There is a constant tension between model improvements (more computations) and model serving latency. So, we are always in a quest of crunching more numbers, while preserving our SLAs, and controlling the operational costs. You will guide our efforts to always find the best tradeoffs in terms of architecture, tooling (Tensorflow serving? / ONNYX? / Triton?) and infrastructure (CPU? / GPU?, GCP? / Azure?) for model serving based on the latest model developments and product requirements. In particular, you will drive principled and scientific load-testing efforts, to clearly identify the tradeoffs at hands, and tune/optimize the model-serving stack. If interested, you will also get some opportunity to work on prompt engineering and agentic systems.

You will achieve scalable and efficient resource management capabilities (cloud infrastructure). You will provide robust and built-in diagnostics for quality control throughout. You will integrate or build labeling tools which can seamlessly integrate at the heart of our conversation data store (GCP, Big Query) and intertwine multiple labeling sources of various confidence levels. Come at the right time, and you will have an enormous opportunity to make a massive impact on the design, architecture, and implementation of an innovative, mission critical product, used every day, by people you know, and which customers love. As part of the emerging tech group, you will also have the additional opportunity of building demos, proof of concepts, creating white papers, writing blogs, etc. Note that this is not a fully remote job, you are required to come to the office (currently at least 2 days a week). Minimum Qualifications 8 + years experience in software engineering or related area. Solid data skills, sound computer-science fundamentals, and strong programming experience.

Today the company runs one of the world’s largest networks that powers millions of websites and other Internet properties for customers ranging from individual bloggers to SMBs to Fortune 500 companies. Cloudflare protects and accelerates any Internet application online without adding hardware, installing software, or changing a line of code. Internet properties powered by Cloudflare all have web traffic routed through its intelligent global network, which gets smarter with every request. As a result, they see significant improvement in performance and a decrease in spam and other attacks. Cloudflare was named to Entrepreneur Magazine’s Top Company Cultures list and ranked among the World’s Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We realize people do not fit into neat boxes. We are looking for curious and empathetic individuals who are committed to developing themselves and learning new skills, and we are ready to help you do that. We cannot complete our mission without building a diverse and inclusive team. We hire the best people based on an evaluation of their potential and support them throughout their time at Cloudflare. Come join us!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Locations Available: London (UK), Lisbon (Portugal)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We are looking for experienced and highly motivated engineers to join our DATA Org and help build the future of data at Cloudflare. Our organisation is responsible for the entire data lifecycle - from ingestion and processing to storage and retrieval - powering the critical logs and analytics that provide our customers with real-time visibility into the health and performance of their online properties.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Our mission is to empower customers to leverage their data to drive better outcomes for their business. We build and maintain a suite of high-performance, scalable systems that handle more than a billion events in a second. As an engineer in our organisation, you will have the opportunity to work on complex distributed systems challenges across different parts of our data stack.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Our Data Organisation is strategically composed of several key teams, each focusing on a distinct aspect of our comprehensive data platform:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Delivery / Data Pipeline: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;This team is responsible for the design, development, and operation of our distributed data delivery pipeline. This system is a high-throughput, low-latency powerhouse, primarily written in Go, and is tasked with ingesting, processing, and intelligently routing massive volumes of data originating from across Cloudflare’s vast global network to multiple core destinations. This involves handling diverse data types and ensuring reliable, timely delivery to various downstream systems.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analytical Database Platform: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Engineers on this team contribute to and evolve our core analytical platform, which is powered by ClickHouse. This team is dedicated to building and maintaining a high-performance, scalable database platform meticulously optimised for the immense analytical workloads generated by all of Cloudflare’s products and services. This includes ensuring data integrity, query optimisation, and continuous platform scalability to meet ever-growing demands.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Retrieval (Customer-Facing Products): &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;This department is focused on building and continuously improving our customer-facing products, making data not only accessible but also genuinely actionable for our users. This department comprises two main groups:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analytics and Alerts: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Members of this group are at the forefront of developing our public APIs such as the GraphQL Analytics API, providing customers and internal Cloudflare teams with flexible access to their data. They will also work on our alerting platform, empowering users to configure and receive near real-time alerts based on the critical logs and metrics observed by our robust data platform. This includes designing intuitive alerting mechanisms and ensuring the reliability of notification systems.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logs and Audit Logs: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;This specialised team is dedicated to building a robust and easy-to-use logging platform that powers reliable data delivery and seamless integrations with customer destinations. The team’s mission is to make it simple for customers to access, manage, and use their log data — ensuring that critical datasets, including comprehensive audit logs, are delivered securely and efficiently to their preferred storage and analysis platforms. The work spans developing intuitive connectors, ensuring data integrity, optimising delivery pipelines, and upholding strict standards for compliance, performance, and usability.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;This role is focusing on the Analytics and Alerts group.

focusing on performance, reliability, and an intuitive user experience.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design, build, and maintain our near real-time alerting platform&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, from data processing and anomaly detection to reliable notification delivery.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optimise the performance of complex analytical queries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;

Today the company runs one of the world’s largest networks that powers millions of websites and other Internet properties for customers ranging from individual bloggers to SMBs to Fortune 500 companies. Cloudflare protects and accelerates any Internet application online without adding hardware, installing software, or changing a line of code. Internet properties powered by Cloudflare all have web traffic routed through its intelligent global network, which gets smarter with every request. As a result, they see significant improvement in performance and a decrease in spam and other attacks. Cloudflare was named to Entrepreneur Magazine’s Top Company Cultures list and ranked among the World’s Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We realize people do not fit into neat boxes.

For example:&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Layers and protocols of the OSI model, such as TCP/IP, TLS, DNS, HTTP&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Reverse and forward proxies and the applications of both&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Security aspects of an internet property, such as Firewalls, WAFs, Bot Management, Rate Limiting, (M)TLS, Zero Trust&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Performance aspects of an internet property, such as Speed, Latency, Caching, Video Streaming, HTTP/2, TLSv1.3&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Enjoying the adventure of troubleshooting and solving technical problems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Understanding why Cloudflare plays an increasingly important role on today’s internet&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ability to proactively identify and solve problems then build sustainable solutions to prevent recurrence&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Demonstrated experience with a scripting language (e.g. Python, JavaScript, Bash) and a desire to expand those skills&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Technical curiosity and passion: Cloudflare is at the cutting edge of internet technology, and our CSEs are viewed as subject-matter experts. It’s incumbent on us to stay up to date not only with Cloudflare’s specific products, but with industry trends.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ability to manage a project, work to deadlines, and prioritize between competing demands&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Fluent in English and Russian, Ukrainian, or Hebrew is a must.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Understanding of, or experience with, regulatory requirements such a PCI DSS, HIPAA, and SOC-2&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Makes Cloudflare Special?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We’re not just a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company. We’re a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company with a soul. Fundamental to our mission to help build a better Internet is protecting the free and open Internet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/protecting-free-expression-online/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project Galileo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;: Since 2014, we&#39;ve equipped more than 2,400 journalism and civil society organizations in 111 countries with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflare’s enterprise customers--at no cost.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudflare.com/athenian/&quot;&gt;Athenian Project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;: In 2017, we created the Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration. Since the project, we&#39;ve provided services to more than 425 local government election websites in 33 states.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.1.1.1/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.1.1.1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;: We released&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.1.1.1/&quot;&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;1.1.1.1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here’s the deal - we don’t store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/privacy/public-dns-resolver&quot;&gt; privacy commitment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Sound like something you’d like to be a part of?

Our product suite includes granular insights into CI/CD pipelines, intelligent test management and optimization, code quality gates, and automated DORA metrics across every major CI provider. This is more than monitoring; it&#39;s about preventing failures, removing bottlenecks and eliminating developer disruptions at scale.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Runtime, Machine learning and Curiosity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This role requires a continued curiosity to explore uncharted spaces while innovating in more established ones. With the rise of AI-generated code, the volume of Pull Requests, CI runs, and Tests is growing fast, creating more noise, higher costs, and new bottlenecks for engineering teams.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We’re tackling the impact of that growth on SDLC by absorbing and root-cause fixing CI instability, and generating/updating/orchestrating thousands of tests using production signals and quantifying how AI impacts SDLC.

Our product suite includes granular insights into CI/CD pipelines, intelligent test management and optimization, code quality gates, and automated DORA metrics across every major CI provider. This is more than monitoring; it&#39;s about preventing failures, removing bottlenecks and eliminating developer disruptions at scale.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Runtime, Machine learning and Curiosity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This role requires a continued curiosity to explore uncharted spaces while innovating in more established ones. With the rise of AI-generated code, the volume of Pull Requests, CI runs, and Tests is growing fast, creating more noise, higher costs, and new bottlenecks for engineering teams.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We’re tackling the impact of that growth on SDLC by absorbing and root-cause fixing CI instability, and generating/updating/orchestrating thousands of tests using production signals and quantifying how AI impacts SDLC. We have an appetite to solve hard problems in clever ways. Our users trust us with their observability data and we work hard to put it to good use for them.&amp;nbsp;At Datadog, we are looking for a &lt;strong&gt;Product Manager II&lt;/strong&gt; to help us evolve the &lt;strong&gt;Software Delivery Suit to work on all these spaces&lt;/strong&gt; to help developers ship faster, safer, and with less cognitive&amp;nbsp;load.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;At Datadog, we place value in our office culture - the relationships and collaboration it builds, and the creativity it brings to the table. We operate as a hybrid workplace to ensure our Datadogs can create a work-life harmony that best fits them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What You’ll Do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uncover Developer / Platform Eng Needs: &lt;/strong&gt;You will conduct user research and analyze&amp;nbsp;usage data to understand how teams at different scales (from startups to massive&amp;nbsp;enterprises) struggle with pipeline noise, testing and deployment risk.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Owning and accelerating parts of the Software Delivery business: &lt;/strong&gt;Drive adoption of&amp;nbsp;CI/CD Visibility, Test Optimization, and Code Quality products, optimize customer&amp;nbsp;onboarding, and ensure robust revenue growth across Platform Engineers and&amp;nbsp;Developers.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Define the experience: &lt;/strong&gt;From intuitive pipeline visibility to intelligent test selection,&amp;nbsp;quality gates, and Auto Test generation - ensuring every developer ships code with&amp;nbsp;confidence and speed.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategize to win the market:&lt;/strong&gt; Partner with Product Marketing and Sales to perfect&amp;nbsp;positioning while enabling field teams to articulate how we help in the larger Datadog&amp;nbsp;suite.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who You Are&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Product Thinker:&lt;/strong&gt; You have &lt;strong&gt;3-5 years of experience&lt;/strong&gt; in Product Management or a&amp;nbsp;combined background in Engineering/DevOps and Product.

You understand concepts like &lt;strong&gt;CI pipelines (GitHub Actions, GitLab), Test&amp;nbsp;Flakiness, Deployment strategies (Canary, Blue/Green)&lt;/strong&gt;, and why developers hate&amp;nbsp;being blocked by infrastructure.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data-Driven: &lt;/strong&gt;You are comfortable with analytics tools to query usage data, prove a&amp;nbsp;hypothesis, and measure the success of a feature launch.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adaptable:&lt;/strong&gt; You are comfortable with ambiguity. Our strategy involves moving fast to&amp;nbsp;solve new problems created by AI coding assistants; you are excited to pivot focus&amp;nbsp;between Testing, CI, and Deployments based on where the biggest value lies.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collaborator: &lt;/strong&gt;You have excellent communication skills and can work effectively with&amp;nbsp;distributed engineering teams, building consensus and keeping projects on track.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Datadog values people from all walks of life.

Today the company runs one of the world’s largest networks that powers millions of websites and other Internet properties for customers ranging from individual bloggers to SMBs to Fortune 500 companies. Cloudflare protects and accelerates any Internet application online without adding hardware, installing software, or changing a line of code.

How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco.

However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts.

    "job_description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the Role Our mandate is to make inference deployment boring and unattended. Anthropic serves Claude to millions of users across GPUs, TPUs, and Trainium — and every model update must reach production safely, quickly, and without disrupting service. We're building the systems that make inference deployment continuous and unattended. As a Software Engineer on the Launch Engineering team, you'll design and build the deployment infrastructure that moves inference code from merge to production. This is a resource-constrained optimization problem at its core: validation and deployment consume the same accelerator chips that serve customer traffic — your deploys compete with live user requests for the same hardware. Every model brings different fleet sizes, startup times, and correctness requirements, so the system must adapt continuously. You'll build systems that navigate these constraints — orchestrating validation, scheduling deployments intelligently, and driving down cycle time from merge to production. If you've built deployment systems at scale and gravitate toward the hardest problems at the intersection of automation and resource management, this team will give you an outsized scope to work on them. Responsibilities Own deployment orchestration that continuously moves validated inference builds into production across GPU, TPU, and Trainium fleets, unattended under normal conditions Improve capacity-aware deployment scheduling to maximize deployment throughput against constrained accelerator budgets and variable fleet sizes Extend deployment observability — dashboards and tooling that answer \"what code is running in production,\" \"where is my commit,\" and \"what validation passed for this deploy\" Drive down cycle time from code merge to production with pipeline architectures that minimize serial dependencies and maximize parallelism Optimize fleet rollout strategies for large-scale deployments across thousands of GPU, TPU, and Trainium chips, minimizing disruption to serving capacity Evolve self-service model onboarding so that new models can be added to the continuous deployment pipeline without Launch Engineering involvement Partner across the Inference organization with teams owning validation, autoscaling, and model routing to integrate deployment automation with their systems You May Be a Good Fit If You Have 5+ years of experience building deployment, release, or delivery infrastructure at scale Strong software engineering skills with experience designing systems that manage complex state machines and multi-stage pipelines Experience with deployment systems where resource constraints shape the design — whether that's fleet capacity, network bandwidth, hardware availability, or coordinated rollout windows A track record of building automation that measurably improves deployment velocity and reliability Proficiency with Kubernetes-based deployments, rolling update mechanics, and container orchestration Comfort working across the stack — from backend services and databases to CLI tools and web UIs Strong communication skills and the ability to work closely with oncall engineers, model teams, and infrastructure partners Strong Candidates May Also Have Experience with ML inference or training infrastructure deployment, particularly across multiple accelerator types (GPU, TPU, Trainium) Background in capacity planning or resource-constrained scheduling (e.g., bin-packing, fleet management, job scheduling with hardware affinity) Experience with progressive delivery in systems with long validation cycles: canary/soak testing, blue-green deployments, traffic shifting, automated rollback Experience at companies with large-scale release engineering challenges (mobile release trains, monorepo deployments, multi-datacenter rollouts) Experience with Python and/or Rust in production systems The annual compensation range for this role is listed below.

However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the Role We're looking for a Recruiting Systems Analyst to build the integrations and automations that power our recruiting function at scale. You'll work at the intersection of recruiting operations, AI application, and systems engineering—building API integrations, automating workflows across the candidate lifecycle, and ensuring data flows correctly between systems. We're looking for someone who can see a manual process, understand the recruiting context behind it, and ship a working solution. The ideal candidate has experience working within the recruiting or people function and picked up technical skills along the way—or has deep integration experience and genuine curiosity about how talent acquisition actually works. Either way, you understand that the best automation respects the human moments in recruiting while eliminating the tedious ones. What You'll Do Build and maintain integrations between recruiting tools (Greenhouse, Gem, ModernLoop, BrightHire) using APIs, webhooks, and automation platforms like Tines Automate manual workflows across the candidate lifecycle—from sourcing to offer to onboarding handoffs Partner with Recruiting Operations to identify high-impact automation opportunities and translate them into technical solutions Own the full lifecycle from discovery through deployment: scoping requirements with recruiting users, building prototypes, gathering feedback, and iterating to production Troubleshoot and resolve integration issues, ensuring data flows correctly between systems Create documentation and lightweight enablement resources so the team can maintain and extend your work Collaborate with internal engineering departments on shared infrastructure while owning the \"middle layer\" of recruiting-specific automations You May Be a Good Fit If You: Have 5+ years of experience in recruiting operations, talent systems, HR technology, or a similar function—you understand recruiting workflows and why they exist Have hands-on experience building automations and integrations using platforms like Tines, Workato, Zapier, or similar tools Are comfortable working with APIs, webhooks—you can read API documentation and build working integrations independently Have used scripting languages (Python, JavaScript) to solve problems, even if you're not a software engineer by training Excel at translating business problems into technical solutions—you ask the right questions to understand what recruiters actually need Have a track record of building trust with non-technical stakeholders and shipping products they actually use Are willing to do the unglamorous work: sometimes the right solution is a well-built spreadsheet, sometimes it's a complex multi-system integration Are excited about AI's potential to transform knowledge work and care about building systems that are safe and beneficial Strong Candidates May Also Have: Experience with LLMs, prompt engineering, and AI application development Experience administering Greenhouse at a configuration and API level Familiarity with Workday integrations and HRIS data flows Experience with data analysis, reporting tools, or building dashboards Understanding of compliance considerations in recruiting (EEOC, GDPR, etc.) Our Current Tech Stack Greenhouse (ATS) Gem (sourcing & CRM) ModernLoop (scheduling) BrightHire (interview intelligence) Tines (automation) Workday (HRIS) JIRA (ticketing) Outline (documentation) Google Workspace Slack The annual compensation range for this role is listed below.

However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains.

How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.

We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research.

How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the Role Anthropic's Human Data Interfaces team builds the systems that collect data to improve our models. This includes novel interfaces for data vendors, tooling, and front-end and back-end infrastructure that enables researchers to gather high-quality data at scale. As a Software Engineer, you'll own the architecture and execution of our data collection pipelines — designing systems that are both performant at scale and resilient to the rapidly changing needs of our research teams. You'll work closely with researchers, our cross-functional data operations partners, and the crowdworkers and vendors who use these tools day-to-day. Responsibilities: Architect and build data collection pipelines that support rapid iteration, balancing data quality and system maintainability Think deeply about the experience of the crowdworkers and vendors using these systems, building interfaces that are clear, efficient, and lead to high-quality data Collaborate closely with research teams to understand evolving data needs and iterate quickly on collection methods Partner with our Human Data Operations team to understand the end-to-end data workflow and design interfaces that make their jobs easier Prioritize and juggle multiple workstreams, making trade-off decisions in a fast-moving environment where research priorities can shift quickly You May Be a Good Fit If You: Believe that advanced AI systems could have a transformative effect on the world and are interested in helping make sure that transformation goes well Are a strong full-stack engineer with broad experience across the stack Are very good at building internal tools, including working with users of the tools to understand their needs Thrive in fast-moving environments where you need to balance speed of iteration with long-term system health Are a quick study—this team sits at the intersection of a large number of different complex technical systems that you'll need to understand (at a high level) to be effective Strong Candidates May Also Have: Experience building human data labelling interfaces, human-in-the-loop systems, or data collection pipelines Familiarity with how preference data and reward models are used in AI model training Experience working with researchers who are internal users/customers Background in building, and improving the user-experience of user-facing applications, particularly those involving complex UI interactions or annotation workflows Strong instincts around system design — building things that evolve gracefully as requirements change Experience influencing technical and product direction on a team The annual compensation range for this role is listed below. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.Annual Salary:$320,000 - $405,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems. About the role: As an Applied AI Security Architect, you will serve as Anthropic's trusted security expert for our most demanding enterprise customers. You'll engage directly with CISOs, security architects, compliance officers, and technical leaders at the world's largest financial institutions, insurance companies, and other highly regulated enterprises to address their most critical questions about deploying Claude safely and securely. This is a pre-sales technical role focused on security, compliance, networking, and data architecture. Your job is to walk into a room full of security professionals and demonstrate deep expertise in enterprise security, regulatory compliance, and data protection. You'll help customers understand Claude's security architecture, data handling practices, and deployment options, and partner with them to design solutions that meet their specific regulatory and organizational requirements. You'll bring significant experience in enterprise security, cloud architecture, and technical pre-sales within regulated industries. Whether you've been a Security Architect, Solutions Architect, Field CTO, or senior pre-sales engineer at a cloud or security vendor, what matters is that you understand how large institutions evaluate and adopt technology, especially in financial services, and can speak credibly to their security and compliance concerns. We are looking for someone excited to help define how enterprises should think about security and compliance in the age of AI. How do MCP, autonomous agents, and RBAC work together? If working at the intersection of AI adoption and regulated industries excites you, this is the role for you. Responsibilities: Serve as the primary security and compliance expert during customer engagements, addressing technical questions about Claude's architecture, data flows, encryption, access controls, and deployment models. Partner with CISOs, security architects, and compliance teams at financial services and insurance companies to understand their security requirements and design solutions that meet regulatory standards (SOC 2, SOX, PCI-DSS, GDPR, state insurance regulations, etc.).

Support enterprise security reviews, vendor assessments, and due diligence processes by providing detailed technical documentation and expert guidance. Collaborate with Sales and Applied AI teams before and after customer engagements to align on strategy, prepare for security discussions, and ensure continuity from initial conversations through deployment. Partner closely with Anthropic’s product and engineering teams to deeply understand Claude's security capabilities, provide real-time customer feedback on feature gaps and priorities, help assess technical feasibility of customer-specific security requirements, and influence roadmap priorities. Develop and maintain security-focused collateral, reference architectures, and best practices documentation for regulated industries. Travel regularly to customer sites for security workshops, architecture reviews, and strategic account meetings. You may be a good fit if you have: 8+ years of experience in enterprise security, cloud architecture, or technical pre-sales, with significant exposure to regulated industries (financial services, insurance, healthcare). Deep technical knowledge of enterprise security concepts: network security, identity and access management, encryption (at rest and in transit), API security, and audit/logging requirements. Experience navigating compliance frameworks relevant to financial services and insurance (SOC 2, SOX, PCI-DSS, GDPR, CCPA, state insurance regulations, banking regulators' guidance on AI/ML). A track record of engaging with CISOs, security teams, and compliance officers at large enterprises. Strong understanding of cloud architecture and deployment models (AWS, Azure, GCP), including VPCs, private endpoints, and hybrid connectivity.

How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

    "job_description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About Beneficial Deployments: Beneficial Deployments ensures AI reaches and benefits the communities that need it most. We partner with nonprofits, foundations, and mission-driven organizations to deploy Claude in education, global health, economic mobility, and life sciences — focusing on raising the floor for those who need it most. About the Role: We're looking for an Applied AI Engineer to join our Beneficial Deployments team, focused on maximizing the impact of Claude in the life sciences. Our goal is ambitious: accelerate scientific progress from R&D through translation by an order of magnitude. That means making Claude the go-to tool for the life sciences ecosystem from early discovery in academia to paradigm shifting biotech to reimaging pharma pipelines — and building the technical infrastructure to back that up. You'll work directly with flagship research partners like Howard Hughes Medical Institute and The Allen Institute, embedded in their scientific workflows. This isn't consulting from the outside — you'll be building alongside their engineers, prototyping agents that fit into real research pipelines, and developing the ecosystem-level tooling (MCP servers, benchmarks, reusable agent skills) that extends Claude's usefulness across the broader life sciences community. This role will be part of the founding Beneficial Deployments applied AI team focused on bringing more of life sciences closer to the frontier and be responsible for building with our partners. Responsibilities: Work as a deep technical partner to flagship life sciences research institutions — understanding their scientific workflows end to end, then advising on where AI can meaningfully accelerate discovery. This means conversations with both PIs and engineering teams, and the ability to hold your own in both. Build hands-on with partner engineering teams. Pair program, prototype, contribute code. Help a research team go from \"we think Claude could help with our analysis pipeline\" to a production system that's actually integrated into how they do science. Develop the ecosystem infrastructure that makes Claude useful across life sciences broadly — MCP servers connecting Claude to domain-specific data sources (genomics platforms, literature databases, experimental repositories), instruments, benchmarks grounded in real scientific tasks, and reusable agent skills that other institutions can adopt without starting from scratch. Help design and evaluate agentic scientific workflows — the kind of systems where Claude isn't just answering questions but actively contributing to experimental design, analysis, and interpretation. Identify what's actually hard about deploying AI in life sciences — the heterogeneous data, the need for auditability, the gap between a promising prototype and something a researcher will trust — and feed those findings back to product, engineering, and research to make the platform better. Create technical content and documentation that lets life sciences partners self-serve. If you build something that works at for one partner, we want it to work for institutes and scientists around the world, without requiring the same level of hand-holding. You Might Be a Good Fit If You Have: 4+ years as a Software Engineer, Forward Deployed Engineer, or technical founder — with production experience shipping systems that real users depend on. Deep experience building LLM-powered applications: prompting, context engineering, agent architectures, evaluation frameworks, deployment at scale. You've debugged evals at 2am and you know what it takes to get from \"works in the notebook\" to \"works in production.\" Meaningful exposure to life sciences, biomedical research, or scientific computing. Enough to understand why a researcher might be skeptical of an AI system, what it means for a workflow to be scientifically rigorous, and where automation genuinely helps vs. where it introduces risk. Bonus if you've worked in genomics, neuroscience, or drug discovery. The ability to work across the scientific stack — read a methods paper critically, think through evaluation design for domain-specific tasks, and reason about the difference between \"this is technically impressive\" and \"this actually advances the science.\" Builder credibility that earns trust with research engineers and scientists. You've shipped products and can speak from experience, not slides. A scrappy founder mentality — comfortable wearing multiple hats, building from scratch, and driving clarity in ambiguous situations. You care about getting the science right, not just the code. The annual compensation range for this role is listed below. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.Annual Salary:$280,000 - $320,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

    "job_description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems. About the role: Claude.ai is one of the most-used AI products in the world, and the experience we build for our users directly shapes how people interact with AI every day. We're looking for a talented engineer to join the team that builds the consumer web app — the interfaces, interactions, and moments that turn Claude from a capable model into a product people genuinely enjoy using. This is a product engineering role first and foremost. You'll work closely with designers and product managers to bring features from concept to shipped experience, obsessing over the details that make the difference: how something feels when you first land on it, how smoothly a new interaction flows, how an interface holds up under real-world use. Great UX isn't just about how something looks — it's about how fast it feels, how reliably it works, and how well it adapts to the device and context someone is using it on. You won't need to be building backend infrastructure or platform tooling — your focus is on crafting the best possible experience for the people using Claude.ai on the web. The pace is fast, the product is evolving quickly, and the opportunity to have a visible, direct impact on how millions of people use AI is real. If you love building consumer products and care about getting the details right, this could be a great fit. Responsibilities: Build and ship user-facing features for claude.ai's web experience, working closely with designers to bring detailed, polished interactions to life Translate design intent into high-quality implementations — paying close attention to accessibility and the small details that add up to a great product feel Build responsive applications that work well across devices and screen sizes, and actively care about the performance characteristics that shape how the product feels to use — latency, responsiveness, and reliability are first-class concerns, not afterthoughts Collaborate tightly with product managers to understand user needs, shape feature scope, and make informed tradeoffs as you build Iterate quickly based on user feedback and internal testing, improving the experience on a continuous basis Work with the UI Platform team to consume shared components and tooling effectively, and flag gaps or pain points that would help the broader team move faster Help maintain a high bar for code quality and consistency within the consumer product codebase You may be a good fit if you: Have 5+ years of experience building consumer-facing web products, with a strong emphasis on UI quality and user experience Are proficient in React, Next.js, and TypeScript, and have experience with Node.js on the backend side of the stack Genuinely care about the user experience — not just how something looks, but how fast it loads, how reliably it works, and how it feels across devices. You think about latency and responsiveness the same way you think about design Collaborate well with designers and product managers, and enjoy the iterative process of turning a design into something that works beautifully in the browser Are comfortable working in a fast-moving environment where priorities shift and shipping quickly matters Pick up slack, even if it goes outside your job description Strong candidates may also have experience with: Accessibility best practices and building inclusive user interfaces Performance optimization for consumer web apps — profiling, reducing bundle size, improving rendering performance, and understanding where latency comes from end-to-end Designing and implementing responsive layouts that work well across screen sizes and devices Working on products with real-time or streaming interactions (chat interfaces, live updates, etc.) User research or usability testing, or a track record of incorporating user feedback into product decisions Working on AI/ML products or in fast-moving consumer product environments Candidates need not have: 100% of the skills needed to perform the job Formal certifications or education credentials The annual compensation range for this role is listed below. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.Annual Salary:$320,000 - $405,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research.

Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.At Anthropic, we believe new AI capabilities are best achieved through secure foundations, not in spite of them. As capabilities grow more advanced, it is critical that progress moves forward safely and for the benefit of all society. It is the reason why security sits at the center of our work, and not as an afterthought. We're specifically looking for a Software Engineer to help us build and maintain new agentic coding tools for developers.

We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

    "job_description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the Role AIRE (AI Reliability Engineering) partners with teams across Anthropic to improve reliability across our most critical serving paths -- every hop from the SDK through our network, API layers, serving infrastructure, and accelerators and back. We jump into the trenches alongside partner teams to make the systems that deliver Claude more robust and resilient, be it during an incident or collaborating on projects. Reliability here is an emergent phenomenon that transcends any single team's boundaries, so someone has to zoom out and look at the whole picture. That's us -- and it means few teams at Anthropic offer this kind of dynamic, cross-cutting exposure to the systems that matter most. Claude has your back. AIRE has Claude's. Help us keep Claude reliable for everyone who depends on it. Responsibilities: Develop appropriate Service Level Objectives for large language model serving systems, balancing availability and latency with development velocity. Design and implement monitoring and observability systems across the token path. Assist in the design and implementation of high-availability serving infrastructure across multiple regions and cloud providers Lead incident response for critical AI services, ensuring rapid recovery, thorough incident reviews, and systematic improvements. Support the reliability of safeguard model serving -- critical for both site reliability and Anthropic's safety commitments. You may be a good fit if you: Have strong distributed systems, infrastructure, or reliability backgrounds -- we're looking for reliability-minded software engineers and SREs. Are curious and brave -- comfortable jumping into unfamiliar systems during an incident and helping drive resolution even when you don't have deep expertise yet. Think holistically about how systems compose and where the seams are. Can build lasting relationships across teams -- our engagement model depends on being welcomed as teammates, not outsiders with opinions. Care about users and feel ownership over outcomes, even for systems you don't own. Have excellent communication and collaboration skills -- you'll be partnering across the entire company. Bring diverse experience -- the team's strength comes from people who've built product stacks, scaled databases, run massive distributed systems, and everything in between. Strong candidates may also: Have been an SRE, Production Engineer, or in similar reliability-focused roles on large scale systems Have experience operating large-scale model serving or training infrastructure (>1000 GPUs). Have experience with one or more ML hardware accelerators (GPUs, TPUs, Trainium). Understand ML-specific networking optimizations like RDMA and InfiniBand. Have expertise in AI-specific observability tools and frameworks. Have experience with chaos engineering and systematic resilience testing. Have contributed to open-source infrastructure or ML tooling. The annual compensation range for this role is listed below. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.Annual Salary:$325,000 - $485,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.
