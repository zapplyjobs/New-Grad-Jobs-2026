How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re looking for a Finance AI Engineer to help build the next generation of AI-powered tools for finance and accounting teams. You&#39;ll work at the intersection of finance operations, AI product development, and engineering—partnering closely with our Finance team to transform how finance professionals interact with data, process documents, and automate their workflows using Claude.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This role offers the opportunity to take full ownership of complex problems at the frontier of AI application in finance. You&#39;ll build Claude Skills and workflows that encode deep institutional knowledge about financial data, accounting conventions, and business logic. Your work will span both internal tools for Anthropic&#39;s finance team and insights that inform external products—directly contributing to our mission of building safe and beneficial AI

FP&amp;amp;A, accounting, and finance systems teams to identify high-value automation opportunities and translate them into production-ready AI workflows&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Design and implement systems that handle OCR, document parsing, and data extraction to transform unstructured finance documents (invoices, contracts, statements) into structured, actionable data&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Develop deep institutional knowledge of Anthropic&#39;s financial data architecture (BigQuery warehouse, accounting conventions, business logic) and encode that knowledge into AI-powered tools&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Own the full lifecycle from discovery through deployment: scoping requirements with finance users, building prototypes, gathering feedback, and iterating to production&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Contribute to the underlying Finance AI platform architecture, including evaluation frameworks, scheduled workflows, and collaboration features&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Build AI-powered workflows that enable natural language queries against financial data systems, automated reporting, and document processing pipelines&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Create technical documentation and provide

understanding their workflows, terminology, and pain points&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Can speak fluently about financial concepts: revenue recognition, accruals, close processes, SOX controls, FP&amp;amp;A reporting cycles&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Have strong software engineering fundamentals and ability to build end-to-end applications&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Have strong SQL skills and experience working with data warehouses (BigQuery, Snowflake) to build analytical products&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Have experience with document processing (OCR), natural language processing, or working with unstructured data&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Have a track record of building trust with non-technical stakeholders and shipping products they actually use&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Thrive building prototypes or MVPs quickly and iteratively in fast-paced environments&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Are excited about

25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

    "job_description": "About us Parallel is a web infrastructure company. Our products are used by leading businesses in sales, marketing, insurance, and coding to build best-in-class AI agents with flexible and powerful programmatic access to the web. We've raised $130 million from Kleiner Perkins, Index Ventures, Spark Capital, Khosla Ventures, First Round, and Terrain to build the web for AIs. We're forming a world-class team of engineers, designers, marketers, sellers, researchers, and operational experts to achieve our mission. About you You're a researcher who thinks like an engineer, or an engineer who thinks like a researcher. You've worked on information retrieval systems, embedding models, or neural ranking at scale, or you're deeply curious about the fundamental problems that emerge when training models to understand and serve billions of web documents. You thrive in the space between theory and production, where elegant solutions must also run efficiently on real infrastructure. You're comfortable reading papers from SIGIR and RecSys one day and debugging distributed training pipelines the next. The role You'll design and train the models that power Parallel's APIs: the intelligence layer that helps AI agents find exactly what they need from the open web. This means tackling research problems that most labs encounter only at hyperscale: How do you train embedding models that capture semantic intent across diverse query types? How do you balance model expressiveness with sub-second retrieval latency? How do you maintain index freshness when the web updates constantly, without rebuilding from scratch? Unlike traditional search engines built for human queries, you're building for AI agents that issue complex, multi-hop queries and expect structured, programmatic responses. This is information retrieval reimagined for the LLM era, work that combines classical IR techniques with modern deep learning, applied at a scale that demands new solutions. Life at Parallel Our team works fully in-person , between our Palo Alto HQ and San Francisco office. We’re a flat, talent-dense organization dedicated to solving technical and creative problems. We seek like-minded individuals who share our passion for applying science, creativity, and consistency to big and complex problems with equally big outcomes. These are our values: Own customer impact: It’s on us to ensure real-world outcomes for our customers. Obsess over craft: Perfect every detail because quality compounds. Accelerate change : Ship fast, adapt faster, and move frontier ideas into production. Create win-wins : Creatively turn trade-offs into upside. Make high-conviction bets : Try and fail. But succeed an unfair amount.

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.Anthropic's Reinforcement Learning organization leads the research and development that trains Claude to be capable, reliable, and safe. We've contributed to every Claude model, with significant impacts on the autonomy and coding capabilities of our most advanced models. Our work spans developing systems that enable models to use computers effectively, advancing code generation through reinforcement learning, pioneering fundamental RL research for large language models, and building scalable training methodologies. The RL org is organized around four key goals: solving the science of long-horizon tasks and continual learning, scaling RL data and environments to be comprehensive and diverse, automating software engineering end-to-end, and training the frontier production model. We collaborate closely with Anthropic's alignment and safety teams to ensure our systems are both capable and safe. Our engineering teams build the environments, evaluation systems, data pipelines, and tooling that make all of this possible: from realistic agentic training environments and scalable code data generation, to human data collection platforms and production training operations. About the Role As a Full-Stack Software Engineer within Reinforcement Learning, you'll build the platforms, tools, and interfaces that power RL environment creation, data collection, and training observability. Our ability to train frontier models depends on generating diverse, high-quality training data — and the products you build are what make that possible for researchers, vendors, and data labelers alike. This is a software engineering role embedded within research teams. You'll own product surfaces end-to-end — from backend services and APIs to web UIs that internal researchers, external vendors, and data labelers rely on daily. You don't need a background in ML research — what matters is strong full-stack engineering skills and the ability to build polished, reliable products in a fast-moving environment.

We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us.

If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About Horizons The Horizons team leads Anthropic's reinforcement learning (RL) research and development, playing a critical role in advancing our AI systems. We've contributed to every Claude release, with significant impact on the autonomy, coding, and reasoning capabilities of Anthropic's models. About the role We're hiring for the Cybersecurity RL team within Horizons. As a Research Engineer, you'll help to safely advance the capabilities of our models in secure coding, vulnerability remediation, and other areas of defensive cybersecurity. This role blends research and engineering, requiring you to both develop novel approaches and realize them in code. Your work will include designing and implementing RL environments, conducting experiments and evaluations, delivering your work into production training runs, and collaborating with other researchers, engineers, and cybersecurity specialists across and outside Anthropic. The role requires domain expertise in cybersecurity paired with interest or experience in training safe AI models. For example, you might be a white hat hacker who's curious about how LLMs could augment or transform your work, a security engineer interested in how AI could help harden systems at scale, or a detection and response professional wondering how models could enhance defensive workflows. You may be a good fit if you: Have experience in cybersecurity research. Have experience with machine learning. Have strong software engineering skills. Can balance research exploration with engineering implementation. Are passionate about AI's potential and committed to developing safe and beneficial systems. Strong candidates may also have: Professional experience in security engineering, fuzzing, detection and response, or other applied defensive work.

But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.

As the team behind v0, Next.js, and AI SDK, Vercel helps customers like Ramp, Supreme, PayPal, and Under Armour build for the AI-native web. Our mission is to enable the world to ship the best products. That starts with creating a place where everyone can do their best work. Whether you're building on our platform, supporting our customers, or shaping our story: You can just ship things.About Startups @ Vercel The Vercel Startups org exists to help founders navigate the shift to AI-native development with confidence. Startups move faster than ever—what used to take years now happens in days—and the decisions founders make early can either unlock scale or become long-term constraints. We partner with startups at the critical moments where technical, commercial, and strategic support starts to matter most. We’re a talent-dense team made up of former founders, engineers, and experienced go-to-market operators who bring firsthand experience building, scaling, and supporting modern software companies. Many of us have sat on the other side of the table, making architectural decisions, navigating tradeoffs, and scaling under real constraints, and we bring that perspective into every customer interaction. We operate with a growth mindset and strong shared ownership. We dig deep to understand our customers, work closely across functions as one team, and find ways to win even when the path forward isn’t obvious. Resilience, curiosity, and a willingness to push through hard problems are table stakes here. This is a team for people who want to operate with high trust, high agency, and high impact — alongside peers who care deeply about helping startups succeed. About The Role You are an expert in Vercel, you have incredible pattern recognition, and are at the bleeding edge of the tech and tools defining how we live and work. In this role, you'll help startups unlock Vercel's full value from adoption through scaling—building relationships with founders and technical leaders who are making critical architectural decisions.

You might be a great fit if you’ve developed this skill set through a range of paths—whether as a builder, founder, engineer, or in a technical go-to-market role—and you bring strong judgment, ownership, and curiosity to how you work. In practice, this looks like someone who: Learns complex technical products quickly and enjoys reasoning about how modern web and AI-native applications are built and scaled Can speak comfortably with developers and founders, using their language and earning credibility through insight rather than titles Has strong sales acumen and experience owning revenue outcomes across a range of deal sizes and complexities Believes that the best revenue outcomes come from deeply successful customers, not transactional selling Brings a thoughtful, opinionated point of view on modern web infrastructure, frontend performance, and scaling tradeoffs Thrives in ambiguity and enjoys shaping how a team and motion evolves from early to more structured Is energized by ownership, accountability, and helping customers make smart decisions What This Role Is Not Not a pure Customer Success role focused on reactive support Not a transactional sales role detached from customer outcomes Not a highly scripted role with narrow ownership or predefined motions This role requires judgment, curiosity, and comfort operating across technical, strategic, and commercial dimensions.

We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us.

How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

As an independent Research Scientist, you’ll build a research program to understand these Emerging Risks. You’ll build evals, run experiments, and look for real world signals to understand how these may come about. You’ll turn this into insights we can use to steer the development and use of the technology more positively. Compared to the team's other focuses, you will focus less on acute catastrophic risks and more on risks that emerge from increasing integration into our world. What You’ll Do: Design and run research experiments to understand the emerging risks models may create Produce internal & external artifacts (research, products, demos, dashboards, tools) that communicate the state of model capabilities Shape product, safeguards, and training decisions based on what you find Work closely with Societal Impacts (SI) and Safeguards teams Sample Projects: Build, run, and study an autonomous AI-powered business (e.g. Project Vend), then identify the growth of real autonomous businesses in the wild using Clio and other tools Build a benchmark for a model’s national security capabilities Red team unsafeguarded models’ abilities to be used for control Identify indicators of models being used to scale movements that rely on social control You May Be a Good Fit If You: Are a fast experimentalist who ships research quickly Have experience creating a research program from scratch Are thoughtful about humanity’s adaptation to powerful AI systems in our economy and society Can communicate thoughtfully in written + spoken form with a wide range of stakeholders Can scope ambiguous research questions into tractable first projects Strong candidates may also have experience with: Building & maintaining large, foundational infrastructure Building simple interfaces that allow non-technical collaborators to evaluate AI systems Working with and prioritizing requests from a wide variety of stakeholders, including research and product teams The annual compensation range for this role is listed below. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.Annual Salary:$350,000 - $850,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

    "job_description": "About Vercel: Vercel gives developers the tools and cloud infrastructure to build, scale, and secure a faster, more personalized web. As the team behind v0, Next.js, and AI SDK, Vercel helps customers like Ramp, Supreme, PayPal, and Under Armour build for the AI-native web. Our mission is to enable the world to ship the best products. That starts with creating a place where everyone can do their best work. Whether you're building on our platform, supporting our customers, or shaping our story: You can just ship things.About Startups @Vercel The Vercel Startups org exists to help founders navigate the shift to AI-native development with confidence. Startups move faster than ever—what used to take years now happens in days—and the decisions founders make early can either unlock scale or become long-term constraints. We partner with startups at the critical moments where technical, commercial, and strategic support starts to matter most. We’re a talent-dense team made up of former founders, engineers, and experienced go-to-market operators who bring firsthand experience building, scaling, and supporting modern software companies. Many of us have sat on the other side of the table, making architectural decisions, navigating tradeoffs, and scaling under real constraints, and we bring that perspective into every customer interaction. We operate with a growth mindset and strong shared ownership. We dig deep to understand our customers, work closely across functions as one team, and find ways to win even when the path forward isn’t obvious. Resilience, curiosity, and a willingness to push through hard problems are table stakes here. This is a team for people who want to operate with high trust, high agency, and high impact — alongside peers who care deeply about helping startups succeed. About The Role You are an expert in Vercel, you have incredible pattern recognition, and are at the bleeding edge of the tech and tools defining how we live and work. In this role, you'll help startups unlock Vercel's full value from adoption through scaling—building relationships with founders and technical leaders who are making critical architectural decisions. You'll analyze usage patterns to identify expansion opportunities, coordinate cross-functional teams to drive outcomes, and guide teams as they adopt AI-native architectures. By leveraging automation and AI to maximize your impact, you'll help refine early plays into repeatable playbooks that scale across our startup portfolio. What You Will Do Build trusted relationships with founders, developers, and technical leaders by quickly developing deep understanding of their architecture, use cases, and technical constraints Use customer signals and usage patterns to determine the right next play and focus time on the highest-leverage opportunities for adoption, expansion, or re-engagement Quarterback customers end-to-end, strategically deploying Sales Engineers, Developer Support Engineers, Product, and Support at the right moments to drive outcomes Own and grow a portfolio of startup customers by partnering with them as they move from early adoption to scale Partner with founders and developers as they adopt AI-native features and architectures, helping them understand how Vercel’s Frontend Cloud fits into a rapidly evolving developer ecosystem and supports new workloads, performance requirements, and scaling patterns Use automation, agents, and self-built workflows to operate at high leverage and focus time and energy on the most impactful customer work Operate comfortably in an evolving environment, helping refine early motions and turn what works into repeatable playbooks About You We’re looking for someone who sits at the intersection of technical curiosity, commercial excellence, and startup mindset. You might be a great fit if you’ve developed this skill set through a range of paths—whether as a builder, founder, engineer, or in a technical go-to-market role—and you bring strong judgment, ownership, and curiosity to how you work. In practice, this looks like someone who: Learns complex technical products quickly and enjoys reasoning about how modern web and AI-native applications are built and scaled Can speak comfortably with developers and founders, using their language and earning credibility through insight rather than titles Has strong sales acumen and experience owning revenue outcomes across a range of deal sizes and complexities Believes that the best revenue outcomes come from deeply successful customers, not transactional selling Brings a thoughtful, opinionated point of view on modern web infrastructure, frontend performance, and scaling tradeoffs Thrives in ambiguity and enjoys shaping how a team and motion evolves from early to more structured Is energized by ownership, accountability, and helping customers make smart decisions What This Role Is Not Not a pure Customer Success role focused on reactive support Not a transactional sales role detached from customer outcomes Not a highly scripted role with narrow ownership or predefined motions This role requires judgment, curiosity, and comfort operating across technical, strategic, and commercial dimensions. If you’re based within a pre-determined commuting distance of one of our offices (SF, Austin or NY), the role includes in-office anchor days on Monday, Tuesday, and Friday. If you're located beyond that distance, the role is fully remote. For location-specific details, please connect with our recruiting team. Benefits: Competitive compensation package, including equity. Inclusive Healthcare Package. Learn and Grow - we provide mentorship and send you to events that help you build your network and skills. Flexible Time Off. We will provide you the gear you need to do your role, and a WFH budget for you to outfit your space as needed. The San Francisco, CA base pay range for this role is $170,000-$209,000. Actual salary will be based on job-related skills, experience, and location. Compensation outside of San Francisco may be adjusted based on employee location. The total compensation package may include benefits, equity-based compensation, and eligibility for a company bonus or variable pay program depending on the role. Your recruiter can share more details during the hiring process. Vercel is committed to fostering and empowering an inclusive community within our organization. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, gender expression or identity, sexual orientation, national origin, citizenship, age, marital status, veteran status, disability status, or any other characteristic protected by law.

    "job_description": "&lt;div class=&quot;content-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ready to be pushed beyond what you think you’re capable of?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At Coinbase, our mission is to increase economic freedom in the world. It’s a massive, ambitious opportunity that demands the best of us, every day, as we build the emerging onchain platform — and with it, the future global financial system.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To achieve our mission, we’re seeking a very specific candidate. We want someone who is passionate about our mission and who believes in the power of crypto and blockchain technology to update the financial system. We want someone who is eager to leave their mark on the world, who relishes the pressure and privilege of working with high caliber colleagues, and who actively seeks feedback to keep leveling up. We want someone who will run towards, not away from, solving the company’s hardest problems.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coinbase.com/mission&quot;&gt;work culture&lt;/a&gt; is intense and isn’t for everyone. But if you want to build the future alongside others who excel in their disciplines and expect the same from you, there’s no better place to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While many roles at Coinbase are remote-first, we are not remote-only. In-person participation is required throughout the year. Team and company-wide offsites are held multiple times annually to foster collaboration, connection, and alignment. Attendance is expected and fully supported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coinbase Asset Management (CBAM) is not just another fund manager; we are the bridge between the world’s most trusted crypto brand and the global institutional asset management. As we scale to become the largest and fastest-growing crypto asset manager in the world, we are looking for a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Senior Associate of Capital Formation &amp;amp; Client Strategy&lt;/strong&gt; to serve as a high-octane engine for our growth.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a high-visibility role reporting directly to the &lt;strong&gt;President of CBAM&lt;/strong&gt;.

We are developing the frontier: tokenization, derivatives, index products, and systematic crypto strategies. We need a &quot;doer&quot; with relentless tenacity and a multi-asset pedigree to help us win.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you’ll be doing (ie. job duties):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You will be a hybrid powerhouse—part sophisticated salesperson, part investment strategist, and a total executor.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global Distribution Engine (50–70%):&lt;/strong&gt; Partner directly with the President to drive outbound sales across North America, Europe, and Asia. You aren&#39;t just &quot;supporting&quot;; you are ensuring every meeting is a masterclass in conversion.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Direct Channel Ownership (20–40%):&lt;/strong&gt; Lead the charge into US Wealth, RIAs, and Family Offices. You will research, propose, and execute Go-To-Market (GTM) strategies that turn prospects into long-term partners.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Feedback Loop:&lt;/strong&gt; Act as the &quot;voice of the market.&quot; You’ll translate client intelligence into sharper marketing narratives and institutional-grade collateral in collaboration with our Marketing &amp;amp; IR leads.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Client Advocacy:&lt;/strong&gt; Post-funding, you ensure our clients stay &quot;delighted.&quot; You’ll represent the investment team’s process across regions, explaining complex strategies (Macro, Systematic, Private Credit) with precision.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we look for in you (ie. job requirements):&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are looking for a &quot;go-getter&quot; who finds genuine joy in the hunt and the build. You should possess some or most of below:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Pedigree:&lt;/strong&gt; 5+ years of institutional sales experience at a top-tier global asset manager.

You can talk Macro, Systematic, and Private Credit in one breath, and Blockchain market structure in the next.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Hustle:&lt;/strong&gt; You are a relentless executor. You are the person who secures the next three meetings before the first one is even over.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Toolkit:&lt;/strong&gt; Proficiency in Bloomberg, Salesforce, and Excel is a baseline; a working familiarity with &lt;strong&gt;AI tools&lt;/strong&gt; to 10x your efficiency is a major plus.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nice to haves:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical Edge:&lt;/strong&gt; Ability to use Python or statistical analysis to look at markets.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Credentials:&lt;/strong&gt; CFA or CAIA designations.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regulatory Knowledge:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding of regional marketing rules and Series 7/3.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why CBAM?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You will join the most prestigious and trusted firm in the crypto space during a period of unprecedented expansion.

We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.

The UI Platform team owns the foundational layer that makes all of this possible: the shared infrastructure, components, APIs, and tooling that let every other product team at Anthropic ship quickly, reliably, and with confidence. As a Software Engineer on this team, you'll be hands-on building the platform that other engineers depend on every day. This means designing and shipping shared components and design-system-level abstractions, evolving the backend-for-frontend (BFF) APIs that power our client applications, and improving the build, deploy, and observability systems that keep Claude.ai running smoothly across surfaces. Your work will directly shape how fast teams across Anthropic can innovate—and how stable their experiences are when they do. This is a great fit if you care deeply about developer experience and want your engineering work to have outsized leverage: instead of shipping one feature, you're building the tools and systems that make dozens of features possible. Responsibilities: Design and build shared UI components, libraries, and abstractions that product teams across Anthropic use to ship consistently and efficiently on web and mobile Contribute to the BFF API layer that powers Claude.ai's client applications—thinking carefully about clean contracts, performance, and reliability at the boundary between frontend and backend Improve developer velocity across the organization by reducing friction in our build, deploy, and testing pipelines Work on performance and reliability: identify and resolve latency issues, improve observability, and help establish high standards that the rest of the platform team can build on Partner closely with product engineering teams to understand their needs, unblock them when possible, and shape platform investments around where the most impact is Help maintain and evolve documentation and tooling that make the platform approachable for engineers joining or building on top of it You may be a good fit if you: Have 5+ years of software engineering experience, with significant time spent building shared platforms, developer tools, or infrastructure that other engineers rely on Have strong practical skills in modern web technologies (React, TypeScript, Next.js) and experience designing or consuming APIs that serve frontend applications Care about developer experience and have a track record of building things that make other engineers more productive Have solid instincts around reliability, observability, and performance—and enjoy operationalizing those instincts in production systems Thrive in fast-paced, collaborative environments and enjoy working closely with cross-functional partners Pick up slack, even if it goes outside your job description Strong candidates may also have experience with: Building shared component libraries or design systems for multiple surfaces (web, mobile, desktop) BFF architectures and API patterns that balance flexibility with consistency across client platforms Performance optimization and latency reduction in consumer-facing applications CI/CD, build systems, and deployment automation Observability and monitoring (metrics, logging, tracing) Working on AI/ML products or in rapidly evolving product environments Candidates need not have: 100% of the skills needed to perform the job Formal certifications or education credentials The annual compensation range for this role is listed below. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.Annual Salary:$320,000 - $405,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us.

How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco.

How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.

Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How We're Different&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong&gt;Guidance on Candidates' AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt; Learn about our policy for using AI in our application process",

    "job_description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the Role Our mandate is to make inference deployment boring and unattended. Anthropic serves Claude to millions of users across GPUs, TPUs, and Trainium — and every model update must reach production safely, quickly, and without disrupting service. We're building the systems that make inference deployment continuous and unattended. As a Software Engineer on the Launch Engineering team, you'll design and build the deployment infrastructure that moves inference code from merge to production. This is a resource-constrained optimization problem at its core: validation and deployment consume the same accelerator chips that serve customer traffic — your deploys compete with live user requests for the same hardware. Every model brings different fleet sizes, startup times, and correctness requirements, so the system must adapt continuously. You'll build systems that navigate these constraints — orchestrating validation, scheduling deployments intelligently, and driving down cycle time from merge to production. If you've built deployment systems at scale and gravitate toward the hardest problems at the intersection of automation and resource management, this team will give you an outsized scope to work on them. Responsibilities Own deployment orchestration that continuously moves validated inference builds into production across GPU, TPU, and Trainium fleets, unattended under normal conditions Improve capacity-aware deployment scheduling to maximize deployment throughput against constrained accelerator budgets and variable fleet sizes Extend deployment observability — dashboards and tooling that answer \"what code is running in production,\" \"where is my commit,\" and \"what validation passed for this deploy\" Drive down cycle time from code merge to production with pipeline architectures that minimize serial dependencies and maximize parallelism Optimize fleet rollout strategies for large-scale deployments across thousands of GPU, TPU, and Trainium chips, minimizing disruption to serving capacity Evolve self-service model onboarding so that new models can be added to the continuous deployment pipeline without Launch Engineering involvement Partner across the Inference organization with teams owning validation, autoscaling, and model routing to integrate deployment automation with their systems You May Be a Good Fit If You Have 5+ years of experience building deployment, release, or delivery infrastructure at scale Strong software engineering skills with experience designing systems that manage complex state machines and multi-stage pipelines Experience with deployment systems where resource constraints shape the design — whether that's fleet capacity, network bandwidth, hardware availability, or coordinated rollout windows A track record of building automation that measurably improves deployment velocity and reliability Proficiency with Kubernetes-based deployments, rolling update mechanics, and container orchestration Comfort working across the stack — from backend services and databases to CLI tools and web UIs Strong communication skills and the ability to work closely with oncall engineers, model teams, and infrastructure partners Strong Candidates May Also Have Experience with ML inference or training infrastructure deployment, particularly across multiple accelerator types (GPU, TPU, Trainium) Background in capacity planning or resource-constrained scheduling (e.g., bin-packing, fleet management, job scheduling with hardware affinity) Experience with progressive delivery in systems with long validation cycles: canary/soak testing, blue-green deployments, traffic shifting, automated rollback Experience at companies with large-scale release engineering challenges (mobile release trains, monorepo deployments, multi-datacenter rollouts) Experience with Python and/or Rust in production systems The annual compensation range for this role is listed below. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.Annual Salary:$320,000 - $485,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time.

How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the role We believe skill with AI is fundamental to human agency. Education Labs builds the paradigms that help people become genuinely more capable—not just more engaged. This is a new kind of role: part researcher, part product builder, part interaction designer. You'll be the second technical builder on a small team studying how AI transforms human capability—and shipping features based on what we discover. You'll have significant creative license to define what \"good\" looks like, exploring new interaction patterns rather than optimizing existing ones. We're skeptical of tutorials, onboarding flows, and engagement metrics. We care about experiences that make users progressively more capable, curious, and empowered over time. This means integrating skill development into product design, using Claude itself as a capability-building partner, and measuring success by how users actually grow. You'll operate as a one-person technical shop: prototyping new ideas, establishing technical direction, and shipping production-quality features to millions of users. You'll need strong product instincts and clean interface design sensibilities, balanced with comfort in ambiguity and frontier thinking. Responsibilities: Ship features that help users develop real skill with AI—measuring success by capability growth, not time-on-site Architect end-to-end prototypes (front-end and back-end) that test new interaction paradigms, with particular attention to the front-of-the-frontend: motion, polish, and interaction feel Define technical direction for the team—establish patterns others can follow Build relationships across Product, Design, and Research to influence how skill development principles shape Anthropic's broader product strategy Shape team strategy and roadmap—identify the highest-leverage opportunities and build conviction across stakeholders Translate research insights about skill development and human-AI collaboration into shipped product through close collaboration with researchers Document and share your work through clear writing, prototypes, and presentations that influence thinking across the organization You may be a good fit if you have: Strong full-stack engineering with design sensibility 6+ years building and shipping web products, with deep expertise across the stack Strong front-end craft: TypeScript/JavaScript, React, CSS—with an eye for interaction design, motion, and visual detail Solid back-end and data pipeline experience: Python, API design, analytics infrastructure A portfolio showcasing innovative interaction designs and high-quality implementations Track record of independently driving features from prototype to production Deep conviction about human capability Strong perspective on how technology should enhance human capabilities rather than diminish them Experience or genuine passion for skill development, HCI, developer tools, or products that help people become more capable Skepticism of purely engagement-driven metrics; interest in measuring capability outcomes Research mindset with product execution Comfort with ambiguity and exploring undefined problem spaces Ability to rapidly prototype, test with users, and iterate toward production Strong instincts for product design and user experience, even without formal design training Strategic leadership and coalition building Experience setting vision, shaping team strategy, and building conviction across cross-functional stakeholders Ability to build productive relationships with Product, Design, Research, and Engineering teams—especially when your team isn't the owner Strong sense of prioritization—knowing what to build now, what to defer, and what to cut Track record of influencing roadmaps and decisions beyond your immediate team Strong candidates may also have: Experience in developer tools, creative tools, learning platforms, or other products where user skill development and mastery matter more than time-on-site Background in learning sciences, cognitive science, HCI, skill acquisition research, or educational psychology (formal or self-directed) Experience with experimentation frameworks, A/B testing, or analytics that measure capability development in production Previous experience in research labs, frontier tech companies, or startups with high autonomy and ambiguity Published writing, talks, or open-source work on skill development, human-AI interaction, or product philosophy Experience building AI-native product experiences or working with LLMs in production contexts Strong candidates may also have Background in learning sciences, cognitive science, HCI, or educational psychology Experience in developer tools, creative tools, or learning platforms where mastery matters more than engagement Published writing, talks, or open-source work on skill development or human-AI interaction Experience building AI-native product experiences or working with LLMs in production What this role is not This is a hands-on technical role building product features, embedded within a research team.

Responsibilities: Maintain the single source of truth for all trainer-facing content — decks, speaker notes, facilitator guides, demo libraries, exercises — and build AI-augmented workflows for keeping it current as Claude's capabilities evolve Design modular content architectures that enable AI-assisted adaptation for different audiences, contexts, and locales without manual rework for each variant Create turnkey champion success packets that enable enterprise champions and partner trainers to run effective internal rollouts with minimal involvement from the education team Build automated quality and consistency checks — rubrics, spot-check processes, drift detection — that maintain Anthropic's standards as content flows through distributed training networks Embed with internal and partner enablement champions to understand what's working, what's missing, and what's changing, then systematize those insights into content updates Partner with our Certification Education Lead to ensure training content aligns with assessment and credentialing requirements Develop and track metrics on content adoption, trainer confidence, and downstream learner outcomes You may be a good fit if you have: 5+ years in enablement, train-the-trainer programs, or learning & development with a systems-building orientation — you think about how to make content maintainable and scalable, not just how to create it Experience creating training content for developers and other technical audiences Experience building and maintaining training content libraries at scale — specifically, building the systems that govern content, not just the content itself A working practice of using AI tools (Claude, LLMs broadly) as core infrastructure in your own workflows — you naturally reach for AI to solve operational and content problems rather than treating it as an occasional assistant Technical fluency sufficient to work confidently with APIs, SDKs, and code-based documentation; this isn't an engineering role, but you should be unintimidated by technical content and comfortable building light tooling or automations Strong instructional design instincts and a passion for continual improvement in how people learn Clear, structured thinking about how to make complex material accessible and how to make that accessibility repeatable Comfort operating in ambiguous, fast-moving environments where you'll build processes from scratch and design them to run with minimal human overhead Strong candidates may also have: Experience building AI-augmented content pipelines or using LLMs for content generation, review, or adaptation at scale Familiarity with LMS platforms, content management systems, or training infrastructure A track record of working cross-functionally with sales, customer success, and partner teams while maintaining an educator's perspective Prior work at a high-growth technology company navigating rapid product change Experience with certification programs or credentialing from the educational content side The annual compensation range for this role is listed below. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.Annual Salary:$270,000 - $365,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

    "job_description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the role: Anthropic is seeking a Certification Content and Systems Architect to design and build the educational content and assessment components that power Anthropic's credentialing efforts. You'll own the substance of what certifications teach and measure: curriculum architecture, assessment design, competency frameworks, and the AI-native systems that let one educator maintain and evolve certification content across multiple programs simultaneously. You'll work closely with go-to-market and partnerships teams who define what certifications are needed and for whom. You own the educational design: what people need to know, how we assess whether they know it, and how we build those learning and assessment experiences to scale through intelligent tooling rather than growing headcount. The broader program strategy — audience planning, pricing, partner relationships — lives with other teams; you're the person who makes the education rigorous, current, and scalable. We're looking for someone who thinks about assessment from first principles — someone skeptical of multiple-choice exams as the default and excited about what becomes possible when AI can evaluate demonstrations of competence, generate adaptive assessments, and maintain item banks that evolve with the product. You should be as comfortable building the tooling and workflows around certification as you are designing the educational content itself. Responsibilities: Design certification curriculum architectures, assessment methodologies, and competency frameworks for product and technical knowledge Build AI-augmented assessment systems — item generation, adaptive testing, competency evaluation — that maintain rigor while scaling without proportional human effort Define competency levels, learning progressions, and assessment rubrics for different certification tiers as defined by program stakeholders Create and maintain the educational content that feeds into certification programs, working with the Train-the-Trainer Lead to ensure alignment between training delivery and credentialing requirements Develop and maintain item banks, assessment instruments, and evaluation rubrics — and build AI-assisted processes for keeping these current as Claude's capabilities evolve Collaborate with GTM, Partnerships, and Customer Success when they identify certification needs — receiving their requirements around audience and business context, then owning the educational design and delivery Establish quality standards for certification assessments including validity, reliability, and fairness Analyze assessment data to continuously improve the learning experience and identify gaps in educational content Build operational tooling for certification administration, verification, and renewal on the educational side You may be a good fit if you have: 5+ years in education, assessment design, credentialing, or developer education — with demonstrated experience designing how competence is measured, not just how content is delivered A working practice of using AI tools as core infrastructure in your workflows — you naturally build AI into your processes for content generation, assessment creation, quality checking, and operational tasks Technical fluency with Claude's products including the API, Claude Code, and Claude.ai — sufficient to design meaningful assessments of real competence with these tools Experience with assessment methodologies beyond multiple-choice: performance-based assessment, portfolio evaluation, adaptive testing, or other approaches that measure applied skill Strong educational design instincts — you think in terms of learning progressions, competency frameworks, and what it actually means to \"know\" something versus having been exposed to it Comfort operating in ambiguous, fast-moving environments and building from scratch — particularly building systems designed to run lean through intelligent automation Clear, structured communication and the ability to work with non-education stakeholders (sales, partnerships) while maintaining an educator's standards Strong candidates may also have: Experience building AI-augmented assessment systems or using LLMs for item generation, evaluation, or adaptive learning Knowledge of psychometrics, credential validation, or assessment quality frameworks Experience with non-traditional methods for tracking and assessing understanding Background in developer education or technical credentialing specifically Familiarity with LMS platforms or certification delivery systems Prior work at a high-growth technology company navigating rapid product change The annual compensation range for this role is listed below.

However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.Anthropic’s Audio team pushes the boundaries of what's possible with audio with large language models. We care about making safe, steerable, reliable systems that can understand and generate speech and audio, prioritizing not only naturalness but also steerability and robustness. As a researcher on the Audio team, you'll work across the full stack of audio ML, developing audio codecs and representations, sourcing and synthesizing high quality audio data, training large-scale speech language models and large audio diffusion models, and developing novel architectures for incorporating continuous signals into LLMs. Our team focuses primarily but not exclusively on speech, building advanced steerable systems spanning end-to-end conversational systems, speech and audio understanding models, and speech synthesis capabilities. The team works closely with many collaborators across pretraining, finetuning, reinforcement learning, production inference, and product to get advanced audio technologies from early research to high impact real-world deployments. You may be a good fit if you: Have hands-on experience with training audio models, whether that's conversational speech-to-speech, speech translation, speech recognition, text-to-speech, diarization, codecs, or generative audio models Genuinely enjoy both research and engineering work, and you'd describe your ideal split as roughly 50/50 rather than heavily weighted toward one or the other Are comfortable working across abstraction levels, from signal processing fundamentals to large-scale model training and inference optimization Have deep expertise with JAX, PyTorch, or large-scale distributed training, and can debug performance issues across the full stack Thrive in fast-moving environments where the most important problem might shift as we learn more about what works Communicate clearly and collaborate effectively; audio touches many parts of our systems, so you'll work closely with teams across the company Are passionate about building conversational AI that feels natural, steerable, and safe Care about the societal impacts of voice AI and want to help shape how these systems are developed responsibly Strong candidates may also have experience with: Large language model pretraining and finetuning Training diffusion models for image and audio generation Reinforcement learning for large language models and diffusion models End-to-end system optimization, from performance benchmarking to kernel optimization GPUs, Kubernetes, PyTorch, or distributed training infrastructure Representative projects: Training state-of-the art neural audio codecs for 48 kHz stereo audio Developing novel algorithms for diffusion pretraining and reinforcement learning Scaling audio datasets to millions of hours of high quality audio Creating robust evaluation methodologies for hard-to-measure qualities such as naturalness or expressiveness Studying training dynamics of mixed audio-text language models Optimizing latency and inference throughput for deployed streaming audio systems The annual compensation range for this role is listed below.

We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us.

How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.

    "job_description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems. About the role: As an Applied AI Security Architect, you will serve as Anthropic's trusted security expert for our most demanding enterprise customers. You'll engage directly with CISOs, security architects, compliance officers, and technical leaders at the world's largest financial institutions, insurance companies, and other highly regulated enterprises to address their most critical questions about deploying Claude safely and securely. This is a pre-sales technical role focused on security, compliance, networking, and data architecture. Your job is to walk into a room full of security professionals and demonstrate deep expertise in enterprise security, regulatory compliance, and data protection. You'll help customers understand Claude's security architecture, data handling practices, and deployment options, and partner with them to design solutions that meet their specific regulatory and organizational requirements. You'll bring significant experience in enterprise security, cloud architecture, and technical pre-sales within regulated industries. Whether you've been a Security Architect, Solutions Architect, Field CTO, or senior pre-sales engineer at a cloud or security vendor, what matters is that you understand how large institutions evaluate and adopt technology, especially in financial services, and can speak credibly to their security and compliance concerns. We are looking for someone excited to help define how enterprises should think about security and compliance in the age of AI. How do MCP, autonomous agents, and RBAC work together? If working at the intersection of AI adoption and regulated industries excites you, this is the role for you. Responsibilities: Serve as the primary security and compliance expert during customer engagements, addressing technical questions about Claude's architecture, data flows, encryption, access controls, and deployment models. Partner with CISOs, security architects, and compliance teams at financial services and insurance companies to understand their security requirements and design solutions that meet regulatory standards (SOC 2, SOX, PCI-DSS, GDPR, state insurance regulations, etc.). Lead technical deep-dives on network architecture, data residency, API security, authentication/authorization, audit logging, and integration patterns for regulated environments. Support enterprise security reviews, vendor assessments, and due diligence processes by providing detailed technical documentation and expert guidance. Collaborate with Sales and Applied AI teams before and after customer engagements to align on strategy, prepare for security discussions, and ensure continuity from initial conversations through deployment. Partner closely with Anthropic’s product and engineering teams to deeply understand Claude's security capabilities, provide real-time customer feedback on feature gaps and priorities, help assess technical feasibility of customer-specific security requirements, and influence roadmap priorities. Develop and maintain security-focused collateral, reference architectures, and best practices documentation for regulated industries. Travel regularly to customer sites for security workshops, architecture reviews, and strategic account meetings. You may be a good fit if you have: 8+ years of experience in enterprise security, cloud architecture, or technical pre-sales, with significant exposure to regulated industries (financial services, insurance, healthcare). Deep technical knowledge of enterprise security concepts: network security, identity and access management, encryption (at rest and in transit), API security, and audit/logging requirements. Experience navigating compliance frameworks relevant to financial services and insurance (SOC 2, SOX, PCI-DSS, GDPR, CCPA, state insurance regulations, banking regulators' guidance on AI/ML). A track record of engaging with CISOs, security teams, and compliance officers at large enterprises. Strong understanding of cloud architecture and deployment models (AWS, Azure, GCP), including VPCs, private endpoints, and hybrid connectivity. Excellent communication skills, including the ability to explain complex security topics clearly to both technical and non-technical audiences. The ability to navigate ambiguity and move fast in a rapidly evolving market. A collaborative mindset: sales at Anthropic is a team sport. Excitement about AI's potential to transform highly regulated industries, and a genuine desire to help customers adopt it safely and responsibly. Deadline to apply: None. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis. The annual compensation range for this role is listed below. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.Annual Salary:$240,000 - $270,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work.

    "job_description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About Beneficial Deployments: Beneficial Deployments ensures AI reaches and benefits the communities that need it most. We partner with nonprofits, foundations, and mission-driven organizations to deploy Claude in education, global health, economic mobility, and life sciences — focusing on raising the floor for those who need it most. About the Role: We're looking for an Applied AI Engineer to join our Beneficial Deployments team, focused on maximizing the impact of Claude in the life sciences. Our goal is ambitious: accelerate scientific progress from R&D through translation by an order of magnitude. That means making Claude the go-to tool for the life sciences ecosystem from early discovery in academia to paradigm shifting biotech to reimaging pharma pipelines — and building the technical infrastructure to back that up. You'll work directly with flagship research partners like Howard Hughes Medical Institute and The Allen Institute, embedded in their scientific workflows. This isn't consulting from the outside — you'll be building alongside their engineers, prototyping agents that fit into real research pipelines, and developing the ecosystem-level tooling (MCP servers, benchmarks, reusable agent skills) that extends Claude's usefulness across the broader life sciences community. This role will be part of the founding Beneficial Deployments applied AI team focused on bringing more of life sciences closer to the frontier and be responsible for building with our partners. Responsibilities: Work as a deep technical partner to flagship life sciences research institutions — understanding their scientific workflows end to end, then advising on where AI can meaningfully accelerate discovery. This means conversations with both PIs and engineering teams, and the ability to hold your own in both. Build hands-on with partner engineering teams. Pair program, prototype, contribute code. Help a research team go from \"we think Claude could help with our analysis pipeline\" to a production system that's actually integrated into how they do science. Develop the ecosystem infrastructure that makes Claude useful across life sciences broadly — MCP servers connecting Claude to domain-specific data sources (genomics platforms, literature databases, experimental repositories), instruments, benchmarks grounded in real scientific tasks, and reusable agent skills that other institutions can adopt without starting from scratch. Help design and evaluate agentic scientific workflows — the kind of systems where Claude isn't just answering questions but actively contributing to experimental design, analysis, and interpretation. Identify what's actually hard about deploying AI in life sciences — the heterogeneous data, the need for auditability, the gap between a promising prototype and something a researcher will trust — and feed those findings back to product, engineering, and research to make the platform better. Create technical content and documentation that lets life sciences partners self-serve. If you build something that works at for one partner, we want it to work for institutes and scientists around the world, without requiring the same level of hand-holding. You Might Be a Good Fit If You Have: 4+ years as a Software Engineer, Forward Deployed Engineer, or technical founder — with production experience shipping systems that real users depend on. Deep experience building LLM-powered applications: prompting, context engineering, agent architectures, evaluation frameworks, deployment at scale. You've debugged evals at 2am and you know what it takes to get from \"works in the notebook\" to \"works in production.\" Meaningful exposure to life sciences, biomedical research, or scientific computing. Enough to understand why a researcher might be skeptical of an AI system, what it means for a workflow to be scientifically rigorous, and where automation genuinely helps vs. where it introduces risk. Bonus if you've worked in genomics, neuroscience, or drug discovery. The ability to work across the scientific stack — read a methods paper critically, think through evaluation design for domain-specific tasks, and reason about the difference between \"this is technically impressive\" and \"this actually advances the science.\" Builder credibility that earns trust with research engineers and scientists. You've shipped products and can speak from experience, not slides. A scrappy founder mentality — comfortable wearing multiple hats, building from scratch, and driving clarity in ambiguous situations. You care about getting the science right, not just the code. The annual compensation range for this role is listed below. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.Annual Salary:$280,000 - $320,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

    "job_description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems. About the role: Claude.ai is one of the most-used AI products in the world, and the experience we build for our users directly shapes how people interact with AI every day. We're looking for a talented engineer to join the team that builds the consumer web app — the interfaces, interactions, and moments that turn Claude from a capable model into a product people genuinely enjoy using. This is a product engineering role first and foremost. You'll work closely with designers and product managers to bring features from concept to shipped experience, obsessing over the details that make the difference: how something feels when you first land on it, how smoothly a new interaction flows, how an interface holds up under real-world use. Great UX isn't just about how something looks — it's about how fast it feels, how reliably it works, and how well it adapts to the device and context someone is using it on. You won't need to be building backend infrastructure or platform tooling — your focus is on crafting the best possible experience for the people using Claude.ai on the web. The pace is fast, the product is evolving quickly, and the opportunity to have a visible, direct impact on how millions of people use AI is real. If you love building consumer products and care about getting the details right, this could be a great fit. Responsibilities: Build and ship user-facing features for claude.ai's web experience, working closely with designers to bring detailed, polished interactions to life Translate design intent into high-quality implementations — paying close attention to accessibility and the small details that add up to a great product feel Build responsive applications that work well across devices and screen sizes, and actively care about the performance characteristics that shape how the product feels to use — latency, responsiveness, and reliability are first-class concerns, not afterthoughts Collaborate tightly with product managers to understand user needs, shape feature scope, and make informed tradeoffs as you build Iterate quickly based on user feedback and internal testing, improving the experience on a continuous basis Work with the UI Platform team to consume shared components and tooling effectively, and flag gaps or pain points that would help the broader team move faster Help maintain a high bar for code quality and consistency within the consumer product codebase You may be a good fit if you: Have 5+ years of experience building consumer-facing web products, with a strong emphasis on UI quality and user experience Are proficient in React, Next.js, and TypeScript, and have experience with Node.js on the backend side of the stack Genuinely care about the user experience — not just how something looks, but how fast it loads, how reliably it works, and how it feels across devices. You think about latency and responsiveness the same way you think about design Collaborate well with designers and product managers, and enjoy the iterative process of turning a design into something that works beautifully in the browser Are comfortable working in a fast-moving environment where priorities shift and shipping quickly matters Pick up slack, even if it goes outside your job description Strong candidates may also have experience with: Accessibility best practices and building inclusive user interfaces Performance optimization for consumer web apps — profiling, reducing bundle size, improving rendering performance, and understanding where latency comes from end-to-end Designing and implementing responsive layouts that work well across screen sizes and devices Working on products with real-time or streaming interactions (chat interfaces, live updates, etc.) User research or usability testing, or a track record of incorporating user feedback into product decisions Working on AI/ML products or in fast-moving consumer product environments Candidates need not have: 100% of the skills needed to perform the job Formal certifications or education credentials The annual compensation range for this role is listed below. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.Annual Salary:$320,000 - $405,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.At Anthropic, we believe new AI capabilities are best achieved through secure foundations, not in spite of them. As capabilities grow more advanced, it is critical that progress moves forward safely and for the benefit of all society. It is the reason why security sits at the center of our work, and not as an afterthought. We're specifically looking for a Software Engineer to help us build and maintain new agentic coding tools for developers. The ideal candidate will have a passion for developer tools, extensive knowledge of diverse programming environments and languages, and experience with advanced LLM features like tool-use, chaining and orchestration patterns, and prompt engineering.

However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

    "job_description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the Role AIRE (AI Reliability Engineering) partners with teams across Anthropic to improve reliability across our most critical serving paths -- every hop from the SDK through our network, API layers, serving infrastructure, and accelerators and back. We jump into the trenches alongside partner teams to make the systems that deliver Claude more robust and resilient, be it during an incident or collaborating on projects. Reliability here is an emergent phenomenon that transcends any single team's boundaries, so someone has to zoom out and look at the whole picture. That's us -- and it means few teams at Anthropic offer this kind of dynamic, cross-cutting exposure to the systems that matter most. Claude has your back. AIRE has Claude's. Help us keep Claude reliable for everyone who depends on it. Responsibilities: Develop appropriate Service Level Objectives for large language model serving systems, balancing availability and latency with development velocity. Design and implement monitoring and observability systems across the token path. Assist in the design and implementation of high-availability serving infrastructure across multiple regions and cloud providers Lead incident response for critical AI services, ensuring rapid recovery, thorough incident reviews, and systematic improvements. Support the reliability of safeguard model serving -- critical for both site reliability and Anthropic's safety commitments. You may be a good fit if you: Have strong distributed systems, infrastructure, or reliability backgrounds -- we're looking for reliability-minded software engineers and SREs. Are curious and brave -- comfortable jumping into unfamiliar systems during an incident and helping drive resolution even when you don't have deep expertise yet. Think holistically about how systems compose and where the seams are. Can build lasting relationships across teams -- our engagement model depends on being welcomed as teammates, not outsiders with opinions. Care about users and feel ownership over outcomes, even for systems you don't own. Have excellent communication and collaboration skills -- you'll be partnering across the entire company. Bring diverse experience -- the team's strength comes from people who've built product stacks, scaled databases, run massive distributed systems, and everything in between. Strong candidates may also: Have been an SRE, Production Engineer, or in similar reliability-focused roles on large scale systems Have experience operating large-scale model serving or training infrastructure (>1000 GPUs). Have experience with one or more ML hardware accelerators (GPUs, TPUs, Trainium). Understand ML-specific networking optimizations like RDMA and InfiniBand. Have expertise in AI-specific observability tools and frameworks. Have experience with chaos engineering and systematic resilience testing. Have contributed to open-source infrastructure or ML tooling. The annual compensation range for this role is listed below. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.Annual Salary:$325,000 - $485,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

Founded in 2016, Verkada has expanded rapidly with 15 offices and 2,200+ full-time employees.The Mission Verkada is dedicated to leading the physical security world into the future with a customer-centric approach and takes pride in its excellent documentation, support, and sales engineering teams. But sometimes things go wrong. The Critical Accounts Program (CAP) is our \"last line of defense\" when we are at risk of losing a relationship. As a CAP Smokejumper, you don’t just manage cases; you drop into and access high-stakes situations, marshall the resources needed to stabilize the client, and ensure they are happy before moving to the next mission. Imagine a major hospital system goes live with Verkada, but a network configuration issue prevents their cameras from recording during a critical event. While others might see a ticket, a Smokejumper sees a partnership in jeopardy. You are the one who gets the call, jumps on a plane that evening, and walks into their command center the next morning to lead our engineers and their IT staff toward a solution. How You’ll Serve Our Customers Rapid Incident Command: Take end-to-end ownership of escalated customer cases, driving swift, high-impact solutions to restore confidence. Executive Advocacy: Serve as the single point of contact for customer executives, providing transparent diagnosis and expedited problem resolution.

Insights for Growth: Translate customer pain points into actionable insights that influence the long-term product roadmap and strengthen long-term partnerships. Who You Are Technical: You know “a lot about something.” We don’t expect you to know networking or physical security in depth before starting, but whatever technology you worked with in the past, you know to a deep level. For example, if you were in wide area networking, you know the nuance of how BGP and DNS work. Or if you worked in storage, you know a lot about file systems. Proven Problem Solver: You have 3–6+ years of experience getting things done. We’re less concerned about what, exactly, so much as that you have had a real impact. Calm Under Pressure: You have a demonstrated ability to manage high-level customers and mission-critical situations with composure. Detail-Oriented: You are highly organized and capable of managing multiple complex escalations simultaneously. Why Join the CAP Team? Joining the CAP team offers a unique impact where, in an established company of over 2,500 people growing very quickly, you will be \"one of one\", a specialist with a role unlike any other in the organization. You are joining a new team that has already seen significant success over the past year and is now expanding to meet the needs of our global customer base.

Founded in 2016, Verkada has expanded rapidly with 15 offices and 2,200+ full-time employees.The Mission Verkada is dedicated to leading the physical security world into the future with a customer-centric approach and takes pride in its excellent documentation, support, and sales engineering teams. But sometimes things go wrong. The Critical Accounts Program (CAP) is our \"last line of defense\" when we are at risk of losing a relationship. As a CAP Engineer, you don’t just manage cases; you drop into and access high-stakes situations, marshall the resources needed to stabilize the client, and ensure they are happy before moving to the next mission. Imagine a major hospital system goes live with Verkada, but a network configuration issue prevents their cameras from recording during a critical event. While others might see a ticket, a Critical Accounts Engineer sees a partnership in jeopardy. You are the one who gets the call, jumps on a plane that evening, and walks into their command center the next morning to lead our engineers and their IT staff toward a solution. How You’ll Serve Our Customers Rapid Incident Command: Take end-to-end ownership of escalated customer cases, driving swift, high-impact solutions to restore confidence. Executive Advocacy: Serve as the single point of contact for customer executives, providing transparent diagnosis and expedited problem resolution. On-Site Deployment: Be ready to travel at a moment’s notice to meet with customers face-to-face or perform in-depth on-site troubleshooting. Strategic Alignment: Coordinate across Engineering, Product, Sales, and Support to prioritize the fixes our customers need most. Insights for Growth: Translate customer pain points into actionable insights that influence the long-term product roadmap and strengthen long-term partnerships. Who You Are Technical: You know “a lot about something.” We don’t expect you to know networking or physical security in depth before starting, but whatever technology you worked with in the past, you know to a deep level. For example, if you were in wide area networking, you know the nuance of how BGP and DNS work. Or if you worked in storage, you know a lot about file systems. Proven Problem Solver: You have 3–6+ years of experience getting things done. We’re less concerned about what, exactly, so much as that you have had a real impact. Calm Under Pressure: You have a demonstrated ability to manage high-level customers and mission-critical situations with composure. Detail-Oriented: You are highly organized and capable of managing multiple complex escalations simultaneously. Why Join the CAP Team? Joining the CAP team offers a unique impact where, in an established company of over 2,500 people growing very quickly, you will be \"one of one\", a specialist with a role unlike any other in the organization. You are joining a new team that has already seen significant success over the past year and is now expanding to meet the needs of our global customer base. In this role, you will develop senior-level decision-making and communication skills while working directly with Verkada’s top decision-makers. Ultimately, you will shine a light on the issues that matter most to ensure no customer is left behind, strengthening Verkada's most critical relationships. Additional Information You must be independently authorized to work in the U.S. We are unable to sponsor or take over sponsorship of an employment visa for this role, at this time.Annual Pay Range At Verkada, we want to attract and retain the best employees, and compensate them in a way that appropriately and fairly values their individual contribution to the company.
