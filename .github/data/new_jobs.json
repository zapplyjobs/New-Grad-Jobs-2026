    "description": "&lt;div class=&quot;content-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ready to be pushed beyond what you think you’re capable of?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At Coinbase, our mission is to increase economic freedom in the world. It’s a massive, ambitious opportunity that demands the best of us, every day, as we build the emerging onchain platform — and with it, the future global financial system.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To achieve our mission, we’re seeking a very specific candidate. We want someone who is passionate about our mission and who believes in the power of crypto and blockchain technology to update the financial system. We want someone who is eager to leave their mark on the world, who relishes the pressure and privilege of working with high caliber colleagues, and who actively seeks feedback to keep leveling up. We want someone who will run towards, not away from, solving the company’s hardest problems.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coinbase.com/mission&quot;&gt;work culture&lt;/a&gt; is intense and isn’t for everyone. But if you want to build the future alongside others who excel in their disciplines and expect the same from you, there’s no better place to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While many roles at Coinbase are remote-first, we are not remote-only. In-person participation is required throughout the year. Team and company-wide offsites are held multiple times annually to foster collaboration, connection, and alignment. Attendance is expected and fully supported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The On‑Site IT Support Engineer delivers white‑glove, security‑first support for an Executive and their household technology environment. This role is the primary, on‑site point of contact for residential IT needs and partners closely with Coinbase’s enterprise IT, executive support, networking, and corporate security teams to ensure a seamless, reliable, and secure experience at all times. The highest degree of professionalism, discretion, and responsiveness is essential.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Deliver white‑glove support executive residential technology systems, including wired and wireless networking, AV, smart home devices, printers, mobile devices, and computers.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Own proactive monitoring and maintenance of the home network, ensuring strong Wi‑Fi coverage, performance, and device health, with clear runbooks for common scenarios and failover connectivity.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Manage and troubleshoot Apple ecosystem devices (macOS, iOS, tvOS, HomeKit) with secure integration to corporate systems, adhering to least‑privilege and zero‑trust principles.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Partner with corporate security and networking to maintain alignment with company security standards and privacy expectations; ensure endpoint compliance, timely patching, and secure identity/MFA practices.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Coordinate external vendors (ISP, AV integrators, smart home/automation providers) for installations, upgrades, and escalations; verify changes meet security and reliability requirements.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Maintain accurate documentation of residential IT assets, configurations, passwords/secrets handling procedures, and service logs; create and update SOPs/runbooks for continuity.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Provide remote and on‑site support outside business hours as needed for critical issues, high‑priority events, or travel preparation.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Prepare executive travel technology end‑to‑end: device readiness, connectivity planning (domestic/international), secure access, and tested contingencies across environments (hotel, aircraft, remote locations).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Support incident response and post‑incident reviews, drive root-cause analysis, and implement preventive measures and observability improvements.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qualifications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;5+ years of IT support experience, including 2+ years supporting executive users in high‑stakes environments.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Expertise in macOS and iOS, plus strong understanding of enterprise connectivity and security (MDM, SSO/identity, MFA, VPN/zero‑trust networking concepts).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Residential systems experience across wired and wireless networking (design, ISP management, firewalls, DNS/DHCP), AV (streaming, conferencing, distribution), and smart home technologies.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Secure configuration, management and monitoring or Ubiquiti, Aruba or similar prosumer grade hardware&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Mesh network design, deployment, and monitoring&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;VLAN configuration, network segmentation, and device isolation to support guests, IoT, and different device classes&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Quality of Service (QoS) configuration and monitoring&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Zwave, Zigbee, Lutron, and other common open and proprietary home automation protocols&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Security‑first mindset with sound judgment on confidentiality, data protection, and least‑privilege access; proven discretion in handling sensitive information.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Exceptional communication and customer service, with the ability to explain complex technical issues clearly, set expectations, and operate with urgency and calm under pressure.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Self‑directed execution with strong problem solving and ownership; able to prioritize, document, and drive tasks to completion with minimal supervision.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Flexible schedule with availability for occasional nights/weekends and rapid response to priority issues.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Comfortable working 75% on-site with frequent travel (mostly within CA)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preferred (Nice to Have)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience supporting C‑level leaders in high‑growth tech or fintech environments.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with regulated or security‑sensitive environments and executive privacy considerations.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Hands‑on experience with network design in complex residential settings (VLANs, mesh/enterprise APs, failover links, monitoring).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Background in AV and smart home ecosystems (e.g., Apple TV/AirPlay, multi‑room audio/video, control systems).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience building SOPs, runbooks, and asset management for high‑availability environments.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;ID: P74725&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pay Transparency Notice&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;em&gt;

In this role, you will build the software that translates AI-generated designs into executable manufacturing instructions and closes the loop between the digital and physical worlds. You will also develop the infrastructure required to encode manufacturing constraints directly into the engineering process before any design has started. You will work at the intersection of CAM, factory systems, and AI, ensuring that when an agent says “design complete,” the shop floor can say “job started.” This role is ideal for someone who cares deeply about real hardware getting built and who is excited to seamlessly bridge AI design with hardware manufacturing. You will be joining the Agentic Computational Engineering (ACE) team, a specialized group within our Advanced Technology Development organization. ACE is responsible for building Voyager’s Generative Engine – the AI-native platform that compresses complex hardware development cycles from years to days. We design agentic AI systems that pair deeply with physics simulation, test data, and modern manufacturing so that Design for Manufacturing (DfM), Design for Assembly (DfA), and Design for Test (DfT) are built into the very first line of code and the very first sketch of a design. Responsibilities: Develop integrations between CAD/CAM systems and shop-floor equipment (CNC machines, printers, inspection tools) to automate manufacturing workflows. Work with partner manufacturers to develop the framework that allows our agentic system to design with their manufacturing constraints already baked in. Build services and scripts that generate toolpaths, feeds, speeds, and process plans from 3D models and process constraints. Implement virtual commissioning and digital twin simulations to validate manufacturing plans and detect collisions or infeasible operations. Integrate factory systems (MES, ERP, inventory) with the ACE platform so design decisions are aware of material availability and capacity. Capture and route manufacturing quality data (CMM measurements, photos, in-process sensors) back into the design and learning loops. Collaborate with manufacturing, quality, and AI teams to define robust, traceable interfaces between design and production. Use LLMs or scripting to automate repetitive integration and data-munging tasks around the factory stack. Required Qualifications: Clearance Required: Ability to obtain and maintain a U.S. Top Secret Security Clearance 0–5 years of experience in industrial automation, robotics, manufacturing software, or related domains (new graduates with strong hands-on projects encouraged to apply). Programming skills in Python and/or C++, with experience integrating with machine controllers, PLCs, or industrial protocols (e.g., OPC-UA, MTConnect) from internships or projects. Familiarity with CAM workflows and G-code, and understanding of CNC machining or additive manufacturing processes (coursework, maker spaces, or shop experience). Exposure to MES/ERP or factory-floor software systems, or strong interest in learning this stack rapidly. Demonstrated use of AI or scripting to automate repetitive engineering or manufacturing tasks. Preferred Qualifications: Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical, Electrical, Industrial Engineering, Computer Science, or a related field. Hands-on experience operating mills, lathes, 3D printers, or other machine tools. Experience building digital twins or simulation environments for manufacturing systems. Evidence of personal projects involving fabrication, robotics, or shop automation. Strong candidates should provide links to outstanding work (or descriptions when not possible to link) and have a strong software and engineering+manufacturing background paired with a passion for leveraging agentic teams for rapid development. Voyager offers a comprehensive, total compensation package, which includes competitive salary, a discretionary annual bonus plan, paid time off (PTO), a comprehensive health benefit package, retirement savings, wellness program, and various other benefits. When you join our team, you’re not just an employee; you become part of a dynamic community dedicated to innovation and excellence.

In this role, you will design, implement, and maintain AI agents that behave like focused junior engineers – thermal analysts, supply-chain scouts, G-code validators, and more. You will sit at the intersection of prompt engineering, tool integration, and evaluation. This role is a fit for someone who already uses LLMs daily, who gets impatient when they can’t automate a task, and who wants to see their agents move real hardware in the loop, not just push text around. You will be joining the Agentic Computational Engineering (ACE) team, a specialized group within our Advanced Technology Development organization. ACE is responsible for building Voyager’s Generative Engine – the AI-native platform that compresses complex hardware development cycles from years to days.

Responsibilities: Design, implement, and deploy production-ready AI agents using frameworks such as LangGraph or Agent Development Kits from Google, OpenAI, or Anthropic. Define clear agent roles, goals, and capabilities, including prompts, tool schemas, and decision-making loops (e.g., ReAct, plan-and-solve). Develop and maintain Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that expose Voyager’s internal systems (PLM, ERP, simulation, repositories) to agents. Integrate external and internal engineering tools (e.g., Ansys, Altium, SolidWorks, Python toolchains) as robust, secure agent tools. Build evaluation suites and benchmarks that measure agent performance on realistic tasks (e.g., exam-style physics problems, PCB routing, CAD edits). Collaborate closely with domain experts to encode manufacturing, test, and safety constraints directly into agent behavior. Use LLMs as a development accelerator for scaffolding code, writing tests, and generating documentation for agent systems. Required Qualifications: 1–5 years of professional software engineering experience (exceptional new graduates and early-career engineers encouraged to apply). Strong proficiency in Python and experience building backend services and APIs or ability to rapidly learn (REST/gRPC). Hands-on experience building LLM-powered agents or tools using frameworks such as LangChain/LangGraph or similar (professional, research, or serious personal projects). Demonstrated habit of using LLMs and agents to accelerate development rather than writing all boilerplate by hand. Experience designing and documenting clean, versioned APIs and data schemas. Preferred Qualifications: Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Engineering, Physics, Mathematics, or a related field; or equivalent experience. Ability to read and reason about schematics, mechanical drawings, and technical documentation. Portfolio of personal projects involving robotics, 3D printing, electronics, or other physical-world builds. Experience building internal tooling for engineering, R&D, or manufacturing organizations.
