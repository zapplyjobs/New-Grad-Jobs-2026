How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

    "employer_name": "Pylon",
    "job_city": "Palo Alto",

    "job_description": "At Pylon, we’re a small team building a very ambitious product in the mortgage space. We've got product-market fit and are looking to scale what we've built We're in search of people who find difficult problems invigorating and who fit well into a high-performing team built on mutual respect and reliance. If you like pushing yourself to learn a massive amount while shipping code that has a huge impact on the end product, Pylon Engineering could be a great place for you. About you You: Have strong opinions that you’re willing to defend. We have a culture of vigorous discussion and debate on technical decisions. We’ll push you to defend your choices, and we want you to push back. Don't settle. Challenge yourself to frequently and consistently deliver exceptional code. If something could be better, take the initiative to improve it. Have great ideas, and lots of them. You should see opportunities all around you to make the code, product and infrastructure better. We’ll give you an environment where you can act on those ideas. Are self-motivated. You can take a goal and drive towards it without needing extensive hand-holding. The team is supportive and loves to share knowledge and advice, but there’s no time for micromanaging your work. Are comfortable with ambiguity. There's a million ways to do things; you should feel at ease making a decision under uncertainty while balancing competing constraints. Are confident you can learn quickly. Mortgage is complex, our platform is complex, good software engineering is complex. You’ve got to have an attitude that you can absorb it, get on top of it, and build something better than what came before. Love strong typing. We're a team full of people who love Haskell and Rust (and Idris!) and take pride in pushing Typescript to its limits. About the Team What we’re not: Building a CRUD app: We’re building a platform that’s only possible due to deep technology investments and thinking hard from first principles. Cargo-culting what’s come before won’t be sufficient. If you’re looking to do mostly plumbing / lego piece assembling, Pylon may be very frustrating for you A ChatGPT wrapper: Mortgage is a sprawling mess of problems, and there isn't one tool that solves every one of them. We use LLMs, but we've reached for tools in multiple disciplines like mixed-integer linear optimization and programming language research. An easy job: We’re building a lot of things from the ground up for the first time. Working at Pylon is like a research project where you have to ship to intelligent, opinionated customers regularly. It’s basically guaranteed you’ll be handed a task that is too difficult for you to do. You might fail sometimes. You might have no idea where to start. Our team leans heavily on each other, but there’s no getting around the difficulties. What we are: A small team: We don’t have an army of engineers. If you find something is broken, you are probably the best one to fix it All the code we write has to punch above its weight in maintainability and toil reduction If you have a good idea, you have much more ability to put it into action than at a large company We need generalists: specialization is for big companies that already have everything figured out. If you’re smart, flexible and like getting into everything, we want you. Working in a regulated space: Mortgage is regulated both federally and at the state level. We move fast, but breaking things isn’t an option. About the Job Basics Job title: Software Engineer Stock options: own a piece of the company and we all win together Health insurance, 401K, dental, etc. Our technology stack: We don’t require that you’ve worked with any of these technologies before, this is just our stack for your information: Typescript front and backend Web components GraphQL PostgreSQL NestJS web framework Nx build system Sagittarius AWS stack using CDK for declarative infrastructure About Pylon The $13 trillion mortgage industry at the core of the American economy runs on broken assembly lines with human-powered workflows, stitched-together software, and a series of capital markets intermediates. The costs to originate are at an all time high despite foundational shifts in technology. Pylon is rewiring mortgages from the ground up. We are building the only API-first, programmatic infrastructure that fully automates credit, compliance, capital, and operations. For the first time, originators can build and scale mortgage businesses entirely through software, not people. Our team comes from Stripe, Better, and Affirm, and we are backed by Conversion Capital, QED, Citi, Fifth Wall, Peter Thiel, and the founders of Ramp, Mercury, Blend, and others.",

    "job_description": "The simple task of buying software, services, or tools at work has become hopelessly complicated at even the most innovative companies in the world. Today, enterprises spend $120T+ per year globally (&gt;30 times larger than annual consumer e-commerce spend) and rely on vendors more than ever before to run their businesses. Our cofounders started Zip in 2020 to address this seemingly intractable problem with a purpose-built procurement platform that provides a simple, consumer-grade user experience. Within the last 4 years, Zip has created a new category and developed the leading solution in this $50B+ TAM space. Today, the world’s leading companies like OpenAI, Snowflake, Anthropic, Coinbase, and Prudential rely on Zip to manage billions of dollars in spend. We have a world-class team coming from category-defining companies like Airbnb, Meta, Stripe, Salesforce, Apple, and Google. With a $2.2 billion valuation and $370 million in funding from Y Combinator, Tiger Global, BOND, DST Global, and CRV, we’re focused on developing cutting-edge technology, expanding into new global markets, and—above all–driving incredible value for our customers. Join us! Your Role The Identity team is responsible for the platforms that manage user access and data confidentiality for customers. As a Software Engineer on the team, you will take on a dynamic role, developing core customer-facing identity products, such as authentication/authorization, user account security, and encryption key management. We move quickly to solve a wide range of complex technical and product challenges. While we are an experienced team that can provide constant guidance and mentorship, we value engineers who can autonomously scope and solve complex technical challenges. You will Design and build product features for enterprise customers, such as AI-powered anomaly detection for payment fraud and account takeovers, granular access control and identity management, and bring-your-own-key encryption. Work closely with cross-functional product and customer-facing teams to understand requirements and ship thoughtful solutions. Work closely with our customers’ security teams (e.g., Discover, Snowflake, and Anthropic) to understand their needs and learn how they assess risk. Build guardrails, tooling, frameworks, and automation to empower software engineers to ship secure changes and prevent vulnerabilities from reaching the main branch. Design and build scalable frontend applications and components. Qualifications Minimum 1+ years of experience in a software engineering role. This role requires software development experience. Experience with web application and API development in production environments. At Zip, our stack includes Python, Typescript, React, and GraphQL. Experience in enterprise SaaS, fintech, software security best practices, and compliance frameworks is a bonus, but not required. The salary range for this role is $150,000 - $180,000. The salary for this position is determined based on a variety of job-related factors that may include location, relevant experience, education, or particular skills and expertise. Perks &amp; Benefits At Zip, we’re committed to providing our employees with everything they need to do their best work. 📈 Start-up equity 🦷 Full health, vision &amp; dental coverage 🍽️ Catered lunches &amp; dinners for SF employees 🚍 Commuter benefit 🚠 Team building events &amp; happy hours 🌴 Flexible PTO 💻 Apple equipment plus home office budget 💸 401k plan We're looking to hire Zipsters and that means hiring people who take ownership, communicate openly, have an underdog mindset, and are excited to increase the pace of innovation for every business in the world. We encourage all candidates to apply even if your experience doesn't exactly match up to our job description. We are committed to building a diverse and inclusive workspace where everyone (regardless of age, religion, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, and more) feels like they belong. We look forward to hearing from you!",
