    "job_description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.Anthropic’s Audio team pushes the boundaries of what's possible with audio with large language models. We care about making safe, steerable, reliable systems that can understand and generate speech and audio, prioritizing not only naturalness but also steerability and robustness. As a researcher on the Audio team, you'll work across the full stack of audio ML, developing audio codecs and representations, sourcing and synthesizing high quality audio data, training large-scale speech language models and large audio diffusion models, and developing novel architectures for incorporating continuous signals into LLMs. Our team focuses primarily but not exclusively on speech, building advanced steerable systems spanning end-to-end conversational systems, speech and audio understanding models, and speech synthesis capabilities. The team works closely with many collaborators across pretraining, finetuning, reinforcement learning, production inference, and product to get advanced audio technologies from early research to high impact real-world deployments. You may be a good fit if you: Have hands-on experience with training audio models, whether that's conversational speech-to-speech, speech translation, speech recognition, text-to-speech, diarization, codecs, or generative audio models Genuinely enjoy both research and engineering work, and you'd describe your ideal split as roughly 50/50 rather than heavily weighted toward one or the other Are comfortable working across abstraction levels, from signal processing fundamentals to large-scale model training and inference optimization Have deep expertise with JAX, PyTorch, or large-scale distributed training, and can debug performance issues across the full stack Thrive in fast-moving environments where the most important problem might shift as we learn more about what works Communicate clearly and collaborate effectively; audio touches many parts of our systems, so you'll work closely with teams across the company Are passionate about building conversational AI that feels natural, steerable, and safe Care about the societal impacts of voice AI and want to help shape how these systems are developed responsibly Strong candidates may also have experience with: Large language model pretraining and finetuning Training diffusion models for image and audio generation Reinforcement learning for large language models and diffusion models End-to-end system optimization, from performance benchmarking to kernel optimization GPUs, Kubernetes, PyTorch, or distributed training infrastructure Representative projects: Training state-of-the art neural audio codecs for 48 kHz stereo audio Developing novel algorithms for diffusion pretraining and reinforcement learning Scaling audio datasets to millions of hours of high quality audio Creating robust evaluation methodologies for hard-to-measure qualities such as naturalness or expressiveness Studying training dynamics of mixed audio-text language models Optimizing latency and inference throughput for deployed streaming audio systems The annual compensation range for this role is listed below. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.Annual Salary:$350,000 - $500,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

    "description": "&lt;div class=&quot;content-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discord is used by over 200 million people every month for many different reasons, but there’s one thing that nearly everyone does on our platform:&lt;strong&gt; play video games.&lt;/strong&gt; Over 90% of our users play games, spending a combined 1.5 billion hours playing thousands of unique titles on Discord each month. Discord plays a uniquely important role in the future of gaming. We are focused on making it easier and more fun for people to talk and hang out before, during, and after playing games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are looking for a highly technical, creative, hands-on, and impact-focused Senior Software Engineer to join our growing Ads team.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our team is revolutionizing the way users interact with our platform through innovative ad formats (including &lt;a href=&quot;https://discord.com/quests&quot;&gt;Quests&lt;/a&gt;). We are driven by a passion for delivering exceptional user experiences while scaling our platform to new heights. These products enable us to generate revenue by building a win-win-win suite of distribution tools for game developers, players, and Discord. Join us in shaping the future of digital advertising and marketplace interactions!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To learn more about Discord Engineering, take a look at our&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.discord.com/tagged/engineering&quot;&gt;engineering blog!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you&#39;ll be doing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Design, build and maintain new Ads products and infrastructure from the backend to frontend. Collaborate with both engineers on and off the team - from Revenue Infrastructure, to Core Tech, to Machine Learning, to Data Science.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Be a strategic partner with engineering, product, and cross functional leadership in designing, developing and scaling digital advertising features that drive revenue growth and enhance user engagement.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Architect simple and maintainable systems to enable us to launch quickly and iterate while sustaining a high product and technical quality bar.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Model strong ownership by acting autonomously when possible and looping in others to build confidence on critical questions. Introduce coding and operational best practices to the team; always be learning &amp;amp; teaching.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Own projects end to end — you’ll be responsible for working with Product and other stakeholders to refine requirements, creating technical designs and specs, implementing changes, and seeing projects through to launch and maintenance.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you should have&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A focus on impact.&lt;/strong&gt; You have a sharp eye for what changes can bring a product from good to great. You collaborate closely with product managers, designers, analysts, and other engineers to define great solutions to business problems.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A sense of ownership.&lt;/strong&gt; You believe in solving a problem completely rather than simply shipping a solution. You operate autonomously and follow through on your commitments.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A growth mindset.&lt;/strong&gt; You view mistakes as learning opportunities and build upon your successes. You challenge yourself and those around you to continuously improve.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A love of mentorship.&lt;/strong&gt; Helping fellow engineers, providing feedback and guidance on system architecture, API design, data modeling, and tradeoffs.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Domain knowledge.&lt;/strong&gt; We’re looking for engineers with experience in the ad delivery space.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;4+ years of experience, with 2 years in relevant roles.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus Points&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Expertise with Typescript, React, React Native, Python and/or Rust&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with experimentation and analysis&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Contributions to open-source projects&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Interest or passion for the Discord platform&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Candidates must reside in or be willing to relocate to the San Francisco Bay Area (Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, Napa, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Solano, and Sonoma counties).
