    "job_description": "At Railway, we make it extremely simple for engineers to deploy logic without thinking about servers. Our goal is to make developers orders of magnitude more efficient by becoming the operating system for modern development. By building tooling for infrastructure automation, we seek to make people 100x more effective, and build 100x more impactful systems. Building leverage is a core part of what we do. We’re seeking a versatile and seasoned Product Designer who strives to create great products, loves collaborating, and takes the initiative. The ideal candidate will derive satisfaction from ideating, designing, and delivering exceptional solutions to hundreds of thousands of developers. This position is tailored for a well-rounded professional who appreciates the art of creative thinking but places equal importance on witnessing their ideas come to life. “Products are made in a factory but brands are created in the mind.” - Walter Landor Want to learn about our work culture? Here is a three-part blog series that will help you see the unique ways our team works (Parts 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 ) About the role Play a pivotal role in Railway's developer experience, redefining the future of software infrastructure. Collaborate closely with product, support, and engineering to scope, define, design, and ship high-quality features. Contribute to the overall design direction of the product, leveraging your creativity and problem-solving skills to address complex design challenges and deliver elegant solutions. Balance user needs, business goals, and technical constraints of design solutions, ensuring that Railway remains user-friendly, scalable, and reliable. Define workflows, prototypes, and visual design of your projects. Learn about our users, how they use our platform, understand their pain points, and propose projects to fix them. Help us maintain and evolve our internal Design System Work in an ambiguous environment to create levers for design excellence, using process sparingly but effectively. Contribute to the design culture within the company. About you You have a strong portfolio showcasing your skills in user interface design, interaction design, and visual design. Your portfolio demonstrates your ability to solve complex design problems and showcases your attention to detail. You care about creating good products, understand what makes a good experience, and constantly think of improvement opportunities for the products you use. You care about business needs, implications, and the practicality of your solutions and work to deliver clear, intuitive, and appealing human interfaces. You are a creative thinker who can push the boundaries of design while ensuring a balance between user needs, business goals, and technical constraints. You feel comfortable designing, illustrating, iterating, and prototyping in Figma, but always look for new tools to open new possibilities (Blender, Spline, Rive, shaders, etc.). You have experience balancing trade-offs while implementing a feature to ship it on time without compromising the long-term product vision. You have experience effectively collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality designs within project timelines. You have excellent communication skills and can articulate design decisions and rationale effectively to stakeholders and team members. We value and love to work with diverse persons from all backgrounds Things to know For better or worse, we're a startup; our team dynamics are different from companies of different sizes and stages. We're distributed ALL across the globe, and that's only going to be more and more distributed. As a result, stuff is ALWAYS happening. We do NOT expect you to work all the time, but you'll have to be diligent about your boundaries because the end of your day may overlap with the start of someone else's. We're a small team, with high ownership, who are not only passionate about what we do, but seek to be exceptional as well. At the time of writing we're 21, serving hundreds of thousands of users. There's a lot of stuff going on, and a lot of ambiguity. We want you to own it. We believe that ownership is a key to growth, and part of that growth is not only being able to make the choices, but owning the success, or failure, that comes with those choices. Benefits and perks At Railway, we provide best in class benefits. Great salary, full health benefits including dependents, strong equity grants, equipment stipend, and much more. For more details, check back on the main careers page . Beyond compensation, there are a few things that we believe that make working at Railway truly unique: Autonomy : We have very few meetings. Just a Monday and a Friday to go over the Company Board. We think your time is sacred, whether it's at work, or outside of work. Ownership : We're a company with a high ownership, high autonomy culture. We hope that you'll come in, help us, and over the course of many years do the best work of your life. When we bring you onboard, we expect you to change the company. Novel problems/solutions : We're a startup that's well funded, with cool problems, which lets us implement novel solutions! We abhor “busywork” and think, whether it's community, engineering, operations, etc there's always opportunity for creative and high leverage solutions. Growth : We want you to grow with us, but we know that talent is loaned, so when you figure out what area you want to grow in next, whether it's at Railway or outside, we'll make sure you land there. How we hire No tricks. No surprises. Here's the entire process. Talk with us about the role This is completely open ended and we're just trying to see who you are, what you want to do, and where you wanna go. Work on a small project to discuss in the interview Review the Railway product and identify one improvement (a redesign of an existing area or a new feature that extends functionality). Then, implement one workflow to illustrate your idea—using either Figma screens, a clickable prototype, or code. Deliverable : One workflow in Figma screens, a Figma prototype, or an implementation in code that communicates your vision and design quality. You'll sit down with someone on the team and go over the above. We'll poke into your solution, as well as get you acquainted with two more members of the team. You can, and SHOULD! ask us questions ahead of time. What our prior solution looks like, what ideas we have to improve it, etc. Ask away! Meet the Team You'll meet the Team, which will be comprised of 4 people from vastly different sections of the company. Looking for: How you work with the rest of the team and communicate. Offer and Details Chat with CEO Finally, we will go over the process, the role, and hammer out the details about your position, onboarding, and all the deets. Final Note : The interview goes both ways . Once again, please ask us things. Many things! Hard things. That's what we're here for.",

    "description": "ABOUT THE ROLE\n\nWe’re looking for a Senior Postgres Security Engineer to join our Postgres Team and help maintain and expand the security, permissions and role system of our hosted Postgres offering. You’ll work closely with customers, partners, product, engineering, support and success, helping us maintain a secure, stable functional Postgres foundation.\n\nThis role is ideal for someone who thrives in async, fast-paced environments and is excited about building developer tools that scale to millions.\n\n\nWHAT YOU’LL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR\n\nWe're looking for a senior PostgreSQL engineer with deep expertise in PostgreSQL internals and proven experience developing extensions in both C and Rust. You should have strong knowledge of PostgreSQL's permission model and security features, including RLS, roles, and grant systems. Experience troubleshooting production issues in managed PostgreSQL environments is essential - you'll need to diagnose and resolve complex problems involving custom extensions, performance bottlenecks, and resource contention. You should be comfortable building testing and owning idempotent deployment to many thousands of running Postgres instances. You should be comfortable diving into PostgreSQL source code, understanding the query planner, executor, and storage engine mechanics. Previous experience with multi-tenant database architectures and working with PostgreSQL at scale is highly valued.\n\n\nYOU MIGHT BE A GOOD FIT IF YOU\n\n - Have 5+ years of experience Postgres security, encryption, RLS and permissions\n\n - Communicate clearly across both technical and non-technical audiences\n\n - Have experience in async or globally distributed teams\n\n - Are energized by solving real-world problems for developers\n\n - Are comfortable navigating ambiguity and moving quickly\n\n\nWHAT WE OFFER\n\n - Fully Remote\n   \n   We hire globally. We believe you can do your best work from anywhere. There are no Supabase offices, but we provide a WeWork membership or co-working allowance you can use anywhere in the world.\n\n - ESOP\n   \n   Every team member receives ESOP (equity ownership) in the company. We want everyone to share in the upside of what we’re building together.\n\n - Tech Allowance\n   \n   Use this budget to set up your ideal work environment—laptop, monitor, headphones, or whatever helps you do your best work.\n\n - Health Benefits\n   \n   Supabase covers 100% of health insurance for employees and 80% for dependents, wherever you are. Your wellbeing and your family’s health are important to us.\n\n - Annual Off-Sites\n   \n   Once a year, the entire company gathers in a new city for a week of connection, collaboration, and fun. It’s a highlight of our year.\n\n - Flexible Work\n   \n   We operate asynchronously and trust you to manage your own time. You know what needs to be done and when.\n\n - Professional Development\n   \n   Every team member receives an annual education allowance to spend on learning—courses, books, conferences, or anything that supports your growth.\n\n\nABOUT THE TEAM\n\nSupabase was born-remote and open-source-first. We believe our globally distributed team is our secret weapon in building tools developers love.\n\n - 180+ team members\n\n - 40+ countries\n\n - 15+ languages spoken\n\n - $496M raised\n\n - 430,000+ community members\n\n - 30,000+ memes posted (and counting)\n\nWe move fast, build in public, and use what we ship. If it’s in your project, we probably use it in ours too. We believe deeply in the open-source ecosystem and strive to support—not replace—existing tools and communities.\n\n\nHIRING PROCESS\n\nWe keep things simple, async-friendly, and respectful of your time:\n\n 1. Apply – Our team will review your application.\n\n 2. Intro Call – A short video chat to get to know each other.\n\n 3. Interviews – Up to four calls with:\n    \n    - Founders\n    \n    - Future teammates\n    \n    - Someone cross-functional from product, growth, or engineering (depending on the role)\n\n 4. Decision – We may follow up with a final question or go straight to offer.\n\nAll communication is remote and we aim to move fast.",
