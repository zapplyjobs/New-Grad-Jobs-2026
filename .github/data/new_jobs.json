However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

Discord plays a uniquely important role in the future of gaming. We are focused on making it easier and more fun for people to talk and hang out before, during, and after playing games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;More broadly, Discord is about empowering people to find belonging in all kinds of communities, and those people trust us to keep their communications safe. Our Platform Security Engineering team protects the systems we use to create Discord, making the “secure way” the “easy way.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We’re looking for a Senior Engineer to advance this mission through security expertise, software development, and operational excellence. In this role, you’ll help identify leveraged opportunities to reduce security risk across Engineering and then you’ll design and deliver technical solutions—lovable “paved paths” for managing identities and access, shipping code, configuring cloud infrastructure, and operating services.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you’re a security engineer who’s deeply curious, eager to own technically and socially complex projects, and excited to improve security and privacy at Discord, read on!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you&#39;ll do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Own software engineering projects end-to-end on a highly-autonomous and horizontally-integrated team with a lot of leverage. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is a code-forward role!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Develop and apply best-in-class secure baselines for cloud infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Secure first- and third-party software supply chains, from the dev environment through CI/CD and into production.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Build and operate identity and access management (IAM) systems that are user-friendly and promote least privilege.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Manage infrastructure vulnerabilities while supporting rapid growth for Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Consult on risk assessments, architectural designs, threat models, code reviews, and more—pragmatically balancing security with other business considerations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example projects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Support IAM with scalable platform solutions (check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://discord.com/blog/access-a-new-portal-for-managing-internal-authorization&quot;&gt;https://discord.com/blog/access-a-new-portal-for-managing-internal-authorization&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build tooling to prevent and address vulnerabilities across our infrastructure.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Integrate service-to-service authentication and authorization into Discord’s internal developer platform.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we look for&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;5+ years of experience building and operating production systems or infrastructure&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;3+ years of experience writing software in a general-purpose programming language (we mainly use Python, Typescript, and Rust)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;3+ years of experience securing systems with millions of users&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Experience designing and building software for customers (internal or external) beyond your immediate team&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Experience securing multi-cloud environments (e.g. GCP, Cloudflare, AWS)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Experience defining and orchestrating containers (e.g. via Kubernetes, Docker, Distroless, OCI)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Familiarity with build and CI/CD technologies (e.g. Terraform, Bazel, Buildkite)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Understanding of modern authentication and authorization concepts (e.g. RBAC, OAuth, Zero Trust network architectures, mTLS)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus points if you have…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Developed and debugged distributed systems atop GCP and Cloudflare&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Led complex migrations or risk management programs across an engineering organization&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Built or operated a service mesh (e.g. Envoy, Istio)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Managed and secured VMs or bare-metal hosts (e.g. Linux, Salt)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Practices to discover industry tools and knowledge that can multiply your team’s impact&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The US base salary range for this full-time position is $196,000 to $220,500 + equity + benefits.

    "job_description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the role We're looking for a Technical Product Marketing Lead who can build experiences that tell the story of AI's transformative potential. You'll create narratives, demos, and interactive experiences across our entire suite of products—the Claude app, Claude Code, and our API platform—that help people truly understand what's possible with AI. This role combines engineering expertise with strategic storytelling: you'll build interactive experiences, craft visual narratives around key AI themes, and create tools that bring abstract concepts to life. Whether it's showcasing how AI enhances creativity, accelerates research, or transforms coding workflows, you'll engineer the assets that help our team and the broader market grasp AI's real-world impact. If you're an engineer who thinks in narratives and loves building things that educate and inspire, this role is for you. Responsibilities: Engineer interactive experiences and visual stories that illustrate AI's impact across different themes—from enhancing human creativity to automating complex workflows—for our largest events and customer moments. Build proof-of-concepts and working examples that demonstrate how Claude transforms real work across industries Create technical content ecosystems—from interactive tutorials to visual explainers—that guide users through their AI journey Develop frameworks and tools that help our sales team tell compelling stories tailored to different audiences Partner with product and engineering to translate our roadmap into narratives that excite customers about what's possible Build data visualizations and interactive dashboards that communicate AI's value in business terms Craft end-to-end experiences that take prospects from curiosity to conviction through hands-on exploration Ship creative technical projects that showcase emerging AI capabilities and inspire new use cases You may be a good fit if you: Have 10+ years building things with code and see engineering as a medium for storytelling Are fluent in modern web tech (Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, React) and can build full-stack experiences Think beyond individual features to understand how pieces fit together into compelling narratives Get excited about making complex technology accessible through thoughtful technical experiences, and have experience presenting to everyone from startup founders to Fortune 500 executives Can seamlessly collaborate with everyone from engineers to designers to sales teams Love shipping projects that educate, inspire, and drive real business outcomes Strong candidates may have: Built technical experiences that told a bigger story—whether for marketing, education, or sales Experience in solutions engineering, developer relations, or technical marketing roles Worked with AI/ML APIs and understand how to showcase their capabilities effectively Created technical content that's driven measurable impact on adoption or understanding Skills with data visualization and interactive web technologies that enhance storytelling A portfolio of projects that demonstrate both technical depth and narrative thinking Role-specific policy: For this role, we expect all staff to be able to work from our San Francisco at least 2 days a week, though we encourage you to apply even if you might need some flexibility for an interim period of time for relocation. Deadline to apply: None. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis.The expected base compensation for this position is below. Our total compensation package for full-time employees includes equity, benefits, and may include incentive compensation.Annual Salary:$320,000 - $400,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

If you&#39;re an engineer who thinks in narratives and loves building things that educate and inspire, this role is for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Responsibilities:&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Engineer interactive experiences and visual stories that illustrate AI&#39;s impact across different themes—from enhancing human creativity to automating complex workflows—for our largest events and customer moments.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build proof-of-concepts and working examples that demonstrate how Claude transforms real work across industries&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Create technical content ecosystems—from interactive tutorials to visual explainers—that guide users through their AI journey&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Develop frameworks and tools that help our sales team tell compelling stories tailored to different audiences&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Partner with product and engineering to translate our roadmap into narratives that excite customers about what&#39;s possible&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build data visualizations and interactive dashboards that communicate AI&#39;s value in business terms&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Craft end-to-end experiences that take prospects from curiosity to conviction through hands-on exploration&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ship creative technical projects that showcase emerging AI capabilities and inspire new use cases&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;You may be a good fit if you:&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have 10+ years building things with code and see engineering as a medium for storytelling&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are fluent in modern web tech (Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, React) and can build full-stack experiences&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Think beyond individual features to understand how pieces fit together into compelling narratives&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Get excited about making complex technology accessible through thoughtful technical experiences, and have experience presenting to everyone from startup founders to Fortune 500 executives&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Can seamlessly collaborate with everyone from engineers to designers to sales teams&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Love shipping projects that educate, inspire, and drive real business outcomes&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Strong candidates may have:&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Built technical experiences that told a bigger story—whether for marketing, education, or sales&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience in solutions engineering, developer relations, or technical marketing roles&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Worked with AI/ML APIs and understand how to showcase their capabilities effectively&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Created technical content that&#39;s driven measurable impact on adoption or understanding&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Skills with data visualization and interactive web technologies that enhance storytelling&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A portfolio of projects that demonstrate both technical depth and narrative thinking&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Role-specific policy:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;For this role, we expect all staff to be able to work from our San Francisco at least 2 days a week, though we encourage you to apply even if you might need some flexibility for an interim period of time for relocation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deadline to apply:&lt;/strong&gt; None. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expected&amp;nbsp;base compensation for this position is below.

However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",
