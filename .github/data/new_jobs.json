More than 500,000 organizations, including 80% of the Fortune 100, rely on Airtable to transform how work gets done.Airtable is the no-code app platform that empowers people closest to the work to accelerate their most critical business processes. More than 500,000 organizations, including 80% of the Fortune 100, rely on Airtable to transform how work gets done. We’re investing deeply in AI to make app building faster, smarter, and more accessible—so anyone can go from an idea to a working Airtable app in minutes. We're looking for an Engineering Manager to lead Airtable's AI Platform pod, which builds the foundational infrastructure and systems that power AI experiences across Airtable. You’ll own the core agent architecture, AI evaluation systems, and platform capabilities that empower internal teams and end users to leverage AI effectively. Your team will be responsible for making AI reliable, scalable, and accessible throughout Airtable–from the underlying agent runtime that orchestrates complex workflows to the semantic search infrastructure that helps users find exactly what they need and powers rich features like linked-record matching. Please note: while we employ a hybrid working model at Airtable (flexible in working from the office or elsewhere), we are looking to hire candidates at this level that are based in San Francisco or New York City who are open to coming into the office at least ~2-3 times/week for team collaboration. What you’ll do Build the AI platform foundation: Own the core agent architecture, orchestration layer, and runtime that powers all AI experiences across Airtable—ensuring it's extensible, reliable, and can scale to support diverse use cases across multiple teams Design for platform scale: Create robust abstractions and APIs that enable other teams to build AI-powered features quickly and safely, while maintaining quality and consistency across the product Establish AI reliability systems: Build comprehensive evaluation frameworks, monitoring, and quality assurance systems that ensure AI features meet enterprise-grade standards for accuracy, performance, and safety Drive technical strategy: Partner with Staff+ engineers to define the technical roadmap for Airtable's AI infrastructure, making architectural decisions that will shape how we build with AI for years to come Enable AI democratization: Build platform capabilities that make sophisticated AI accessible to all Airtable users—from semantic search and natural language interfaces to intelligent automation—without requiring technical expertise Who you are Platform builder at heart: You think in systems and abstractions. You've built infrastructure that other teams depend on and understand how to balance flexibility with reliability Technical depth with strategic thinking: You can dive deep into architectural decisions while keeping sight of the broader platform vision and how it enables the business Systems thinker with shipping velocity: You can architect for the long term while delivering incremental value. You know how to build platforms through iteration rather than big-bang releases AI infrastructure experience: You've worked on ML platforms, agent frameworks, or AI infrastructure at scale. You understand the unique challenges of building reliable systems on top of probabilistic models Quality through architecture: You believe the best way to ensure quality isn't through process but through well-designed systems—building platforms that make it easy to do the right thing Strong technical and management growth trajectory: 5+ years experience as an engineer (previously in a staff or TL level IC position) and 1+ years as a manager, or a similar combination.
