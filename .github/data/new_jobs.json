We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the role Claude.ai is Anthropic's flagship consumer product, spanning web, mobile, desktop, and browser extensions—and it's growing fast. We're looking for an engineering leader to own the foundational platform that powers all of these surfaces: the shared infrastructure, APIs, tooling, and systems that enable product teams to ship reliably, quickly, and with confidence. In this role, you'll lead the team responsible for reliability, latency, developer velocity, and common components across Claude.ai's UI surfaces. This includes the backend-for-frontend (BFF) APIs that power our client applications. Your work will directly determine how fast customer, partner, and product teams can innovate—and how stable their experiences are when they ship. This is a highly technical leadership role: you'll stay close to the code, drive architectural decisions, and build the systems that let others move faster. This is a unique opportunity to shape the developer experience and platform foundations for one of the most rapidly evolving AI products in the world. You'll partner closely with product engineering teams, infrastructure, and leadership to ensure Claude.ai scales gracefully as we grow. Responsibilities Lead and grow the UI Platform team, setting technical direction for reliability, performance, and developer experience across all Claude.ai surfaces Own the foundational systems that product teams depend on: shared components, BFF APIs, build and deploy pipelines, observability, and performance infrastructure Design and evolve the API layer that powers Claude.ai's client applications, ensuring clean abstractions and reliable contracts for product teams Drive improvements to developer velocity—reducing friction, improving tooling, and enabling teams to ship features faster and more safely Establish and maintain high standards for latency, reliability, and quality across the platform Partner closely with product engineering, infrastructure, and leadership to align platform investments with product priorities Create clarity and direction in a fast-moving, ambiguous environment where priorities shift as Claude.ai evolves Build a culture of technical excellence, collaboration, and continuous improvement within your team You may be a good fit if you Have 10+ years of software engineering experience, with significant time spent building platforms, developer tools, or infrastructure for consumer-facing products Have 5+ years of engineering leadership experience, including managing and growing teams in high-growth environments Have deep expertise in modern web development stacks (React, Next.js, TypeScript) and experience designing APIs that serve frontend applications Are passionate about developer experience and have a track record of building tools and systems that make other engineers more productive Have strong opinions on reliability, observability, and performance—and know how to operationalize those opinions at scale Can balance technical depth with strategic thinking, staying hands-on while also setting long-term direction Thrive in ambiguity and can create structure and clarity for your team when the path forward isn't obvious Communicate effectively across functions and can build alignment with product, design, and infrastructure partners Strong candidates may also have experience with Building and scaling platforms for multiple surfaces (web, mobile, desktop, extensions) with shared infrastructure Designing BFF architectures and API patterns that balance flexibility with consistency Performance optimization and latency reduction in consumer-facing applications CI/CD, build systems, and deployment automation at scale Observability and monitoring systems (metrics, logging, tracing) Working on AI/ML products or in rapidly evolving product environments The annual compensation range for this role is below. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. Our total compensation package for full-time employees includes equity and benefits.Annual Salary:$405,000 - $485,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science.

Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.
