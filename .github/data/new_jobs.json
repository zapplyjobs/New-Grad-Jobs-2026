Our platform ingests high-rate telemetry, validates complex autonomy software in real time, and enables engineers to iterate faster without sacrificing safety or precision. We’re a small, fast-moving team of engineers and operators who own problems end-to-end, work across disciplines, and thrive on challenges at the intersection of hardware and software.\nAs a dual-use platform, we serve top-tier commercial and defense customers, including the U.S. Navy, United States Air Force, Shield AI, and Anduril. We’re backed by Sequoia, General Catalyst, Founders Fund, Lux Capital, and Lightspeed Ventures. Our team draws experience from SpaceX, Palantir, Anduril, Applied Intuition, and other leading companies — united by a common mission: enabling hardware engineers to push the boundaries of advanced technology with speed, safety, and precision.\nIn this pivotal role, you'll deliver Nominal’s vision of providing continuous testing to the industrial base, equipping engineers to deploy capability, at scale, in the shortest time possible. You’ll be working across accounts ranging from large enterprises to innovative startups, selling a modern software platform to hardware organizations. It’ll be your role to demonstrate and communicate how our technology fits into their existing stack and helps them meet their critical testing outcomes. You will also be counted on to shape the early sales team and its culture.\n",
