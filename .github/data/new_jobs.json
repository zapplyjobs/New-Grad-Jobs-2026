We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco.

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the role At Anthropic, we're building AI systems that are safe, beneficial, and transformative. Our mission is to develop AI that benefits humanity, and we believe the most powerful capabilities emerge when we thoughtfully bridge the gap between research breakthroughs and real-world applications. Anthropic Labs serves as our internal accelerator. We're looking for the next breakout hits that bring substantial revenue or transform an industry. We operate in close partnership with research and build through fast iteration cycles. Past successes include Claude Code and MCP. We're seeking versatile, entrepreneurial engineers to join Labs. In this role, you'll work at the intersection of cutting-edge research and real-world application, rapidly building and testing new experiences, working directly with researchers and users, and generating the insights that shape Anthropic's product future. You'll need to be comfortable with ambiguity, willing to kill your own projects when the data says to, and energized by the pace of building in uncharted territory. Responsibilities Rapidly prototype full-stack applications that showcase emerging AI capabilities, shipping early and often to maximize learning Collaborate closely with research teams to understand new model capabilities and translate them into intuitive user experiences Work directly with internal test users and external partners to gather feedback, iterate quickly, and validate (or invalidate) product concepts Design and run structured experiments to test hypotheses, balancing creative exploration with rigorous evaluation Generate documentation and insights to guide successful prototypes toward full product teams Advocate for user experience and product considerations early in the research process Provide feedback to research teams about model effectiveness and where capabilities can be improved Flexibly contribute across Labs initiatives based on organizational priorities and emerging opportunities—context from one project should inform the next You may be a good fit if you Have 8+ years of experience building full-stack applications, with a track record of zero-to-one work in startup or startup-like environments Thrive in ambiguity and are energized (not anxious) by uncertainty—you're comfortable working on projects that might not exist in three months Have a hacker mentality: high agency, bias toward shipping, comfort with technical debt when it's the right tradeoff Are deeply user-centric—you validate ideas with actual users before over-investing and talk about problems before solutions Can articulate learnings from failed or killed projects without defensiveness; you treat your work as experiments Hold strong opinions loosely—you advocate forcefully for ideas but change your mind based on evidence Are a generalist who can transition between different problem spaces as priorities shift Work independently with good judgment about what matters, without needing constant direction Have strong technical skills across modern web development stacks (React, Node.js, Python, etc.) and are comfortable with APIs, databases, and cloud technologies Communicate effectively and translate complex AI capabilities into intuitive experiences Care about the societal impacts and ethics of your work Strong candidates may also have Experience building products that involve AI/ML components or working with large language models Experience collaborating directly with research teams in AI/ML environments Background conducting user research, interviews, and usability testing Experience across both B2B and B2C product development, or in multiple industries Design sensibility or hands-on experience with UI/UX for AI-powered applications Experience with real-time applications, WebSocket implementations, or complex frontend interactions What we're not looking for at this stage Deep specialists who can't adapt if their domain becomes irrelevant Engineers who've only succeeded in big-company structures with well-defined processes and long timelines People who are precious about their work or frame all past projects as successes Those who need clear roadmaps and get stressed by shifting priorities Candidates need not have 100% of the skills listed above Formal certifications or education credentials Direct machine learning or AI research experience Deadline to apply: None.

How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

    "job_description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the role We are looking for backend / platform software engineers to join our Product Foundations org. We build foundational primitives that help accelerate product development across Anthropic. Some examples of what we own and maintain are our core sampling pipeline, our rate limiting platform, and our RAG platform. We have multiple teams that are currently hiring. Team placement occurs after the interview process, taking into account your interests and experience alongside organizational needs. This flexible approach allows us to match talented engineers with the platform efforts where they'll have the greatest impact and growth potential: Billing Platform: We build and operate the billing infrastructure that powers all of Anthropic's products - enabling revenue collection across different pricing models, subscriptions, and multi-entity operations for global compliance. You'll work on distributed systems that need to be both fast and correct: real-time tracking, revenue reconciliation across payment providers, and ledger systems that ensure accuracy at scale. This is production-critical infrastructure where data consistency matters, and you'll collaborate closely with finance, product, and accounting teams to build the foundation that scales our business. If you've built billing platforms or payment systems, that will be a big plus. Product Platform: We provide a set of stable, powerful, and easy to use shared product capabilities leveraged by the Claude.ai, API and other internal product and research teams. You’ll work on our core platform components like rate limiting, LLM sampling and multimodal processing. Our mandate includes developing reusable components, improving system performance, and creating scalable abstractions that accelerate product development across the organization while maintaining high standards for reliability and security. Product Dev Prod: We work on maximizing the developer productivity of product engineers at Anthropic. You'll architect and optimize the critical development infrastructure that powers our AI product development, including dev environments, developer tooling, and CI/CD pipelines. You’ll partner closely with product teams to understand their development workflow and eliminate friction points. Your work will have an extraordinary multiplier effect, enhancing productivity across our entire product organization and accelerating our mission. Accounts Platform: We build and maintain the critical infrastructure that powers identity and authentication across Anthropic's product suite. We work closely with product teams, security, support, and trust & safety as customers.

We maintain a user-centric approach, building reliable systems that our users and company can depend on as we tackle complex challenges at the intersection of security, scalability, and user experience. Claude Execution: We build the infrastructure that enables Claude to safely interact with the outside world through the use of tools. Our team owns the platform that provides secure, isolated execution environments as well as the infrastructure that connects Claude to external services via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). You'll work on challenging problems at the intersection of security and capability: designing sandboxes that are both secure and performant, building reliable MCP infrastructure, and expanding our platform for enterprise deployments. We collaborate closely with product teams across Claude.ai, API, and Claude Code to deliver the execution capabilities that make Claude genuinely useful for real-world tasks. Relevant experience includes containerization, secure execution environments, and developing for enterprise requirements. Responsibilities: Build and scale platform components to handle Anthropic’s rapid growth Design and architect platform components that are composable and deliver value for a variety of use cases Collaborate closely with product teams to understand their needs and build platform capabilities that accelerate their feature delivery Make build vs buy decisions, evaluating and implementing 3rd party solutions when most impactful Set technical direction and vision for various product and platform features Partner with research to quickly prototype and launch new capabilities based on research breakthroughs You might be a good fit if you: Have 6+ years of practical experience as a backend or platform engineer building scalable distributed systems Have strong coding skills and experience with service-oriented architectures Have worked in early start-up or otherwise fast moving, rapidly evolving environments, and have ideally built products from 0 to 1 Take full ownership of your work, navigate ambiguity effectively, and proactively overcome obstacles to deliver results Are comfortable diving into any part of the system, whether it's infrastructure, services, or product frontends, to deliver effective solutions Enjoy working with a fast-paced team tackling cutting-edge problems in AI safety and conversational AI Take a product-focused approach and care about building solutions that are robust, scalable, and easy to use Enjoy pair programming (we love to pair!) Have a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Software Engineering or comparable experience Strong candidates may also: Have worked with NLP and ML models and understand their capabilities and limitations Have experience with REST APIs Have experience with React and Frontend frameworks The annual compensation range for this role is listed below.

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is seeking a Linux OS and System Programming Subject Matter Expert to join our Infrastructure team. In this role, you&#39;ll work on accelerating and optimizing our virtualization and VM workloads that power our AI infrastructure. Your expertise in low-level system programming, kernel optimization, and virtualization technologies will be crucial in ensuring Anthropic can scale our compute infrastructure efficiently and reliably for training and serving frontier AI models.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Optimize our virtualization stack, improving performance, reliability, and efficiency of our VM environments&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Design and implement kernel modules, drivers, and system-level components to enhance our compute infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Investigate and resolve performance bottlenecks in virtualized environments&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Collaborate with cloud engineering teams to optimize interactions between our workloads and underlying hardware&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Develop tooling for monitoring and improving virtualization performance&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Work with our ML engineers to understand their computational needs and optimize our systems accordingly&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Contribute to the design and implementation of our next-generation compute infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Share knowledge with team members on low-level systems programming and Linux kernel internals&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Partner with cloud providers to influence hardware and platform features for AI workloads&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You may be a good fit if you:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have experience with Linux kernel development, system programming, or related low-level software engineering&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Understand virtualization technologies (KVM, Xen, QEMU, etc.) and their performance characteristics&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have experience optimizing system performance for compute-intensive workloads&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are familiar with modern CPU architectures and memory systems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have strong C/C++ programming skills and ideally experience with systems languages like Rust&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Understand Linux resource management, scheduling, and memory management&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have experience profiling and debugging system-level performance issues&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are comfortable diving into unfamiliar codebases and technical domains&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are results-oriented, with a bias towards practical solutions and measurable impact&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Care about the societal impacts of AI and are passionate about building safe, reliable systems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong candidates may also have experience with:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;GPU virtualization and acceleration technologies&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Cloud infrastructure at scale (AWS, GCP)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Container technologies and their underlying implementation (Docker, containerd, runc, OCI)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;eBPF programming and kernel tracing tools&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;OS-level security hardening and isolation techniques&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Developing custom scheduling algorithms for specialized workloads&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Performance optimization for ML/AI specific workloads&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Network stack optimization and high-performance networking&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience with TPUs, custom ASICs, or other ML accelerators&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Representative projects:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Optimizing kernel parameters and VM configurations to reduce inference latency for large language models&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Implementing custom memory management schemes for large-scale distributed training&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Developing specialized I/O schedulers to prioritize ML workloads&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Creating lightweight virtualization solutions tailored for AI inference&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Building monitoring and instrumentation tools to identify system-level bottlenecks&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Enhancing communication between VMs for distributed training workloads&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deadline to apply:&lt;/strong&gt; None. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The annual compensation range for this role is listed below.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (&quot;OTE&quot;) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Annual Salary:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-range&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$300,000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;divider&quot;&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;$405,000 USD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logistics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education requirements: &lt;/strong&gt;We require at least a Bachelor&#39;s degree in a related field or equivalent experience.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Location-based hybrid policy:&lt;/strong&gt; Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco.
