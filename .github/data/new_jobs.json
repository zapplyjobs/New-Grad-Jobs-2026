Specific responsibilities may include: Transform and optimize the storage of reactor data and physics results Design and configure CI/CD pipelines to perform multiphysics analyses Build tools for reactor engineers to visualize, compare, and evaluate reactor designs and their physics Integrate simulation tools into our analyses pipelines Implement physics kernels to solve unanswered problems, or to improve performance of existing models Develop reactor optimization schemes and statistical experiments to inform design changes Identify and improve process-related inefficiencies in reactor design that can be addressed with software Minimum Qualifications: Bachelor’s degree in computer science, computer engineering, or equivalent work experience 0–2 years of professional software engineering experience (internships, co-ops, or significant projects are a plus) Fluency in Python Proficiency with Git Curiosity and passion for nuclear power, closing the nuclear fuel cycle, and sustainable energy generation Bonus Qualifications: Experience with CI/CD, preferably GitLab Experience with Rust Experience with Typescript/Javascript (especially Svelte) Experience with optimization, statistics, or design of experiments Who you are: A startup person: You aren't driven by titles or hierarchy, and prefer efficiency to excess process. You don't need or expect to have a lot of guidance but you enjoy working in a fast-paced team. If you prefer the culture and feel of a large organization, that is great, but you likely won’t enjoy working with us! There is plenty of important work and plenty of good opportunities with organizations like that. Motivated: You are self-motivated. You bring an enthusiasm to the team, and imbue a sense of passion that goes beyond clocking in and clocking out.

An excellent communicator: We need a person who is not only technically competent but also a clear and upbeat communicator. Creative: Being creative means that when things fall outside clear scopes or processes or problems arise without clear solutions, you are able to identify it as well as invent ways to solve a problem or fill a need without micromanagement. The successful person in this job will not only be creative, but also enjoy being creative and solving open-ended problems which may change day-by-day. Detail-oriented: This focus is a big part of excellence, consistency, and quality. Excellent grammar and spelling matter for both good communication as well as the image of the company that we put forward.
