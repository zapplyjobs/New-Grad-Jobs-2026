    "job_description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the role: Anthropic’s performance and scaling teams focus on making the most efficient and impactful use of our compute resources, be it inference or training. As an Engineering Manager on these teams you will be responsible for ensuring you and your team are identifying and removing bottlenecks, building robust and durable solutions, and maximizing the efficiency of our systems. You also will help bring clarity, focus, and context to your teams in a fast paced, dynamic environment. Responsibilities: Provide front-line leadership of engineering efforts to improve model performance and scale our inference and training systems Become familiar with the team’s technical stack enough to make targeted contributions as an individual contributor Manage day-to-day execution of the team's work Prioritize the team’s work and manage projects in a highly dynamic, fast paced environment Coach and support your reports in understanding, and pursuing, their professional growth Maintain a deep understanding of the team's technical work and its implications for AI safety You may be a good fit if you: Have 1+ years of management experience in a technical environment, particularly performance or distributed systems Have a background in machine learning, AI, or a similar related technical field Are deeply interested in the potential transformative effects of advanced AI systems and are committed to ensuring their safe development Excel at building strong relationships with stakeholders at all levels Are a quick learner, capable of understanding and contributing to discussions on complex technical topics Have experience managing teams through periods of rapid growth and change Are a quick study: this team sits at the intersection of a large number of different complex technical systems that you’ll need to understand (at a high level of abstraction) to be effective Strong candidates may also have experience with: High performance, large-scale ML systems GPU/Accelerator programming ML framework internals OS internals Language modeling with transformers The expected base compensation for this position is below. Our total compensation package for full-time employees includes equity, benefits, and may include incentive compensation.Annual Salary:$425,000 - $560,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

    "description": "&lt;div class=&quot;content-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Anthropic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;About the role&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a State and Local Government Account Executive at Anthropic, you&#39;ll drive the adoption of safe, frontier AI across South and Central US state and local government agencies. You&#39;ll leverage your deep understanding of state and local government operations and consultative sales expertise to propel revenue growth while becoming a trusted partner to customers, helping them embed and deploy AI while uncovering its full range of capabilities. In collaboration with GTM, product, and marketing teams, you&#39;ll help refine our approach to the state and local government market while maintaining the highest standards of security and compliance.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Responsibilities:&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Drive new business and revenue growth specifically within state and local government agencies, owning the full sales cycle from initial outreach through deployment&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Navigate the unique requirements of state and local government procurement, including state-specific regulations, security standards, and agency-specific requirements&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build and maintain relationships with key decision-makers across state, county, and municipal agencies, becoming a trusted advisor on AI capabilities and implementation&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Develop and execute strategic account plans that align with agency missions and modernization initiatives&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Coordinate closely with cloud service providers (AWS, GCP) and system integrators to ensure successful deployment and integration&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Provide detailed market intelligence and customer feedback to product teams to ensure our offerings meet state and local government requirements&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Create and maintain sales playbooks specific to state and local government use cases and procurement processes&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Take a leadership role in growing our state and local government presence while maintaining hands-on engagement with key accounts&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Collaborate across teams to ensure coordinated delivery of commitments and maintain appropriate documentation of customer engagements&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;You may be a good fit if you have:&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;5+ years of enterprise sales experience in the state and local government space, with a proven track record of driving adoption of emerging technologies&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Deep understanding of state and local government agency missions, challenges, and technology needs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Demonstrated ability to balance strategic leadership with hands-on sales execution&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience navigating complex state and local procurement processes and compliance requirements&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Strong track record of exceeding revenue targets in the state and local government space&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Extensive experience with state and local government contracting vehicles and procurement mechanisms&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Excellent relationship-building skills across all levels, from technical teams to senior agency leadership&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Proven ability to coordinate across multiple stakeholders, including cloud providers and system integrators&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Strategic thinking combined with attention to detail in execution&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with state-specific data privacy laws and security compliance frameworks&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A passion for safe and ethical AI development, with the ability to articulate its importance in government contexts&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deadline to apply:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;None. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expected&amp;nbsp;base compensation for this position is below. Our total compensation package for full-time employees includes equity, benefits, and may include incentive compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Annual Salary:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-range&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$290,000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;divider&quot;&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;$360,000 USD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logistics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education requirements: &lt;/strong&gt;We require at least a Bachelor&#39;s degree in a related field or equivalent experience.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Location-based hybrid policy:&lt;/strong&gt; Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",
