Become an expert in building systems that can scale to processing millions of users, transactions, car detections, payments etc. Learn with urgency, independently, and using your peers as sparing partners for ideas. Your work will be meaningful to the company right away. There are no useless Blissway employees, everyone’s work must be essential. You will be trusted to make your own decisions and share the responsibility of prioritizing our goals with the team. No dedicated PMs to tell you what to do. What we offer Annual salary between $125k and $175k depending on experience; significant stock option package; top-tier medical, vision and dental insurance; 401k. Hybrid work. Work three days a week at HQ in South Denver. Rest of the week is up to you. Four weeks of vacation per year. We push you to take them! At-the-office breakfast, lunch, and snacks are on the company. About Blissway The company is profitable; We say most of our problems are 1 to 100, with a few still 0 to 1. Blissway is a startup that simplifies the collection of tolls and greatly improves highway safety. In a way, we are multiple startups in one: deep tech, AI/ML, fintech, hardware, SaaS, IoT, transportation, and GovTech. For the past five years we have built a nearly insurmountable software &amp; hardware technological lead in tolling and highway safety, under-the-radar industries that are bigger than football. Demand for Blissway’s tech is such that we stopped taking government contracts for 2025. With a 20-person all-star team achieving more than competitors with 4k employees, this is your opportunity to have an oversized impact in the massive Interstate Highway System covering every metropolitan area in the US (well, minus Juneau AK). You are a good fit if you Are smart, hard working, and care about the work that you do. You like a challenge. Code really well. Which language you are most proficient is not important, as long as you learn fast. We mostly use Python and Typescript. Have incredible eye for detail. Takes ownership of projects and puts in the necessary time to meet deadlines. A recent company survey showed the team is averaging 50 hours to get their tasks done, with occasional bursts for bigger deadlines. Excel at solving hard problems and take full ownership. We expect you to figure out what you need to get stuff done. Flexible to help all areas of the company when other teams need a boost. Usually this is a great opportunity to learn and get exposure to new tech. If you are uncomfortable with the idea of fluid teams or only want to work on niche things, this will not be a good fit. We have extremely talented SWE team members who want you to learn and succeed. They will guide you but this would be a bad fit if you are hoping a training program, you must throw yourself at the problems. If you want to learn more, let's talk!",
