About the Role: Gusto is seeking motivated, customer-centric professionals interested in being considered for future health insurance benefits customer experience opportunities in 2026. These roles are ideal for customer-facing benefits professionals who thrive in a fast-paced, consultative environment and are passionate about helping small businesses succeed. As a seasoned Health Insurance Benefits Advocate, you will act as the single point of contact for all benefits support and renewal inquiries, enhancing user experience and serving as a subject matter expert for Gusto’s core products. You’ll help employers get group benefits for the very first time, and then help those employers continue to make important benefits decisions on an annual basis. Together, we’re not just simplifying benefits — we’re helping small businesses offer competitive, people-first benefits that support happier, healthier teams. Here’s what you’ll do day-to-day: Own the customer journey by building trust, rapport, and partnership with customers through inbound and outbound phone, email, and Zoom interactions. Provide passionate, opinionated, consistent, expert, reliable support as a point of contact for health insurance benefits inquiries. Partner with internal teams to address and resolve customer inquiries and concerns throughout the benefits renewal process. Leverage AI‑assisted tools to accelerate research and communication while upholding accuracy, compliance, and Gusto’s voice. Identify churn risk and quickly act to deliver solutions to mitigate the risk of churn, using your health insurance benefits and product knowledge and unique understanding of each individual customer. Build and maintain relationships built on trust and collaboration with admins to better understand and anticipate their needs. Think creatively, pivot quickly, live in ambiguity, and collaborate strategically. You will be required to expand your critical thinking skills and creatively problem-solve across all areas of the business, with an understanding of a variety of stakeholders and needs. Here’s what we're looking for: 3-6 years of customer experience with 1+ years of full-time experience in health insurance benefits. Account Management experience preferred. Life & Health Insurance Producers Licensure preferred. Proven ability to proactively and reactively support customers, driving their success, happiness, and loyalty through expert guidance and creative problem-solving.

Sitting within the IT and Enterprise Applications organization, you will partner closely with Product, Engineering, Finance, People Tech, and Operations to bridge business needs with AI driven solutions. You will act as the connector between business requirements and AI frameworks, designing Model Context Protocols (MCPs) and AI agents that make enterprise workflows smarter, faster, and more autonomous. In line with Gusto’s FY26 Enterprise Systems strategy, you will help shift our ERP and Finance systems from reactive workflows to predictive, context aware, and self improving platforms, while ensuring security, compliance, and measurable impact. This role combines hands-on technical execution with strategic systems thinking, using integration fluency, AI literacy, and business empathy to create the connective tissue that allows AI to seamlessly augment enterprise operations. About the Team: This role will report to the Enterprise AIT team, a group focused on driving the intelligent transformation of Gusto’s enterprise systems.

Govern the full lifecycle of MCPs and agents, ensuring adherence to enterprise data governance, privacy, and security standards, including SOX compliance, auditability, and appropriate access controls. Measure and optimize impact by defining and tracking KPIs such as automation adoption, efficiency gains, agent accuracy, reliability, and cost performance, and using those insights to guide iteration. Enable and influence the organization by partnering with IT, Security, and business stakeholders to build reusable AI frameworks, coach teams on safe and effective AI driven workflows, and champion AI first practices across day to day operations. Here’s what we're looking for: 8+ years in Business Systems Analysis, Enterprise Applications, or Automation roles, with a track record of delivering impact in complex environments. Demonstrated experience building and maintaining integrations across systems such as Jira, NetSuite, or similar, with a strong grasp of APIs, JSON, and RESTful service design. Hands-on knowledge of AI agent frameworks (for example LangChain, CrewAI, Semantic Kernel, MCP) and experience designing or maintaining Model Context Protocols or equivalent frameworks. Familiarity with leading LLM platforms (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini etc.) and practical experience with prompt engineering. Proficiency in Python or JavaScript for automation, orchestration, and building modular, scalable AI workflows that translate complex requirements into executable solutions. Strong documentation, analytical, and stakeholder communication skills, with the ability to clearly explain tradeoffs and align technical solutions with business needs.

We believe in high-ownership Product Managers who operate like business owners — owning an entire roadmap end to end and shipping product all the way from strategy through to the nitty-gritty details (some describe this kind of role as a “GM” type role). Our Product team is lean, which means you’ll have a high degree of impact and ownership. We believe in smaller, empowered teams that move quickly with less overhead. You’ll move fast by pairing sharp product judgment with fluency in AI tools — automating what slows teams down and amplifying what makes them creative and high-performing.
