    "description": "&lt;div class=&quot;content-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ready to be pushed beyond what you think you’re capable of?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At Coinbase, our mission is to increase economic freedom in the world. It’s a massive, ambitious opportunity that demands the best of us, every day, as we build the emerging onchain platform — and with it, the future global financial system.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To achieve our mission, we’re seeking a very specific candidate. We want someone who is passionate about our mission and who believes in the power of crypto and blockchain technology to update the financial system. We want someone who is eager to leave their mark on the world, who relishes the pressure and privilege of working with high caliber colleagues, and who actively seeks feedback to keep leveling up. We want someone who will run towards, not away from, solving the company’s hardest problems.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coinbase.com/mission&quot;&gt;work culture&lt;/a&gt; is intense and isn’t for everyone. But if you want to build the future alongside others who excel in their disciplines and expect the same from you, there’s no better place to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While many roles at Coinbase are remote-first, we are not remote-only. In-person participation is required throughout the year. Team and company-wide offsites are held multiple times annually to foster collaboration, connection, and alignment. Attendance is expected and fully supported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-block=&quot;true&quot; data-editor=&quot;fn4is&quot; data-offset-key=&quot;9v5ct-0-0&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr&quot; data-offset-key=&quot;9v5ct-0-0&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a 12-week internship during summer 2026.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Coinbase is seeking interns to join our Product Design team to understand user needs for existing products like Coinbase.com, Prime, Wallet, etc. You will contribute to unique, large scale, highly complex product problems.
