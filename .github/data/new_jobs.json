We handle the hard stuff—like payroll, health insurance, 401(k)s, and HR—so owners can focus on their craft and customers. With teams in Denver, San Francisco, and New York, we’re proud to support more than 400,000 small businesses across the country, and we’re building a workplace that represents and celebrates the customers we serve. Learn more about our Total Rewards philosophy. About the Role: This role requires a deep understanding of strategic planning, agile methodology, and program management, with an ability to unify priorities across diverse technical and operational functions. You will collaborate closely with leaders across all CXPI sub-teams, as well as Operations leaders, and CX as a whole, to own the intake, prioritization, sprint execution process, communication, and execution by driving efficiency and ensuring that all initiatives align with strategic CX goals. About the Team: As a Program Manager for Workforce Management (WFM) Programs, you will be a key leader within the CX Planning & Insights team, reporting to the Head of Strategy and Tool Administration. You will be responsible for leading and executing strategic programs focused on optimizing our workforce management capabilities, primarily leveraging the NICE WFM platform. Here’s what you’ll do day-to-day: Establish and manage the centralized intake process for new work across the Data, Quality, WFM, and Tool Administration sub-teams. Partner with leadership to prioritize the backlog, ensuring resource allocation focuses on the highest-impact initiatives aligned with CX goals. Lead and manage complex, cross-functional programs that span multiple CX teams. Oversee end-to-end delivery, ensuring projects are delivered on time, within scope, and meet business objectives. Act as the execution lead, facilitating agile ceremonies (e.g., sprint planning, daily stand-ups, sprint reviews, retrospectives) for the CXPI sub-teams to ensure a smooth and predictable delivery cadence. Serve as the central communication hub, providing clear, consistent, and transparent updates on program status, risks, and dependencies to stakeholders across all levels, including CX leadership and partner teams. Collaborate with cross-functional teams, including CX Operations, Planning, Scheduling, Intraday Management, Technology, and Analytics, to gather requirements, manage dependencies, and ensure successful program execution that directly benefits the WFM teams. Proactively identify, assess, and mitigate risks and issues that could impact the delivery of projects across the sub-teams. Manage complex dependencies between Data, Quality, WFM, and Tool Administration initiatives. Drive continuous improvement in program management, prioritization, and execution methodologies within the CXPI organization to increase team velocity and efficiency. Develop and maintain comprehensive program documentation, including roadmaps, program plans, status reports, and key decision logs. Here’s what we're looking for: 7-10+ years of progressive experience in program management, agile delivery, or strategic operations, ideally supporting technical or analytical teams within a high-growth environment. Proven experience managing a cross-functional work intake and prioritization process for multiple sub-teams (e.g., Data, Engineering, Operations, or WFM). Deep understanding and practical experience with agile/scrum methodologies and a track record of successfully facilitating sprints and managing program backlogs. Exceptional program management skills, including planning, execution, risk management, and stakeholder communication for complex, multi-faceted initiatives. Strong ability to influence and build consensus across diverse technical and non-technical teams, including high-level cross-functional leadership. Excellent analytical and problem-solving skills with the ability to synthesize complex information from different sources (Data, Quality, WFM) into actionable execution plans. Proficiency in project management and agile tools (e.g., Jira, Asana, NotionAI). Experience in contact center operations or Workforce Management (WFM) environments is a strong plus. Our cash compensation amount for this role is $94,285/yr to $122,571/yr in Denver & most major metro locations, and $114,695/yr to $149,104/yr for San Francisco & New York.

Learn more about our Total Rewards philosophy. About the Role: Gusto is seeking an experienced Workforce Scheduling / Intraday Team Lead who thrives on strategic thinking and solving complex contact center challenges. Reporting into the Workforce Management (WFM) team, you will play a critical role in scaling operations to support Gusto’s next phase of growth. While this role does not have formal direct reports, it carries strong leadership influence. You will serve as the scheduling subject-matter expert, process owner, trainer, and primary point of contact for multi–line-of-business scheduling operations. Lead and optimize scheduling across multiple lines of business, ensuring alignment between forecasts, staffing, skill mix, shift design, and service-level goals. Act as the primary point of contact for scheduling-related questions, decisions, and escalations, especially when management is unavailable. Own and maintain scheduling documentation, including procedures, job aids, governance guidelines, escalation protocols, and version-controlled process flows. Drive continuous improvement by identifying inefficiencies, standardizing practices, and recommending automation or tooling enhancements. Ensure operational readiness for staffing changes, training blocks, peak events, special projects, and business transitions by anticipating impacts and adjusting schedules to maintain service levels and employee engagement. About the Team: You’ll partner closely with WFM analytics, operations leadership, HR/training, and vendor or agency partners to ensure scheduling strategies support business goals and a strong customer experience. Provide training, guidance, and mentorship to schedulers, WFM peers, and operations stakeholders to ensure clarity on scheduling processes, tools, and change controls. Collaborate with WFM analytics and operations leaders to deliver insights on scheduling performance, including forecasting accuracy, schedule adherence, occupancy, shrinkage, and staffing variances. Prepare dashboards and executive-ready summaries and present findings to senior leadership. Facilitate cross-functional coordination to align scheduling strategy with customer experience standards and workforce needs. Here’s what you’ll do day-to-day: Own the end-to-end scheduling process for all supported lines of business—translating forecast and staffing plans into optimized schedules that balance operational efficiency, employee experience, and service level attainment. Serve as the primary point of contact (POC) for all scheduling-related escalations, change requests, and optimization opportunities; provide clear guidance and resolution in partnership with Real-Time Management and Operations. Collaborate cross-functionally with Forecasting, Intraday Management, Operations, and Vendor Management to ensure cohesive workforce strategies that align with business priorities and evolving support needs. Lead weekly scheduling and staffing reviews, bringing forward data-driven insights on performance-to-plan, shrinkage trends, and schedule adherence; facilitate informed decision-making among WFM and Operations partners. Provide peer-level mentorship and training to schedulers, fostering consistency, accuracy, and adoption of best practices in alignment with SWPP scheduling standards. Act as a knowledge resource for tools, systems, and governance protocols. Analyze schedule efficiency, shrinkage, and coverage trends, identifying gaps or inefficiencies; recommend and implement data-informed improvements to enhance utilization, flexibility, and service delivery. Partner with WFM leadership to design and refine scheduling policies, procedures, and automation strategies—driving innovation and standardization across the scheduling discipline. Maintain and continuously improve documentation for scheduling workflows, standards, templates, and change control processes—ensuring clarity, audit readiness, and cross-team alignment. Support operational readiness by proactively planning for peak events, business changes, and special projects; anticipate impacts and adjust schedules to maintain SLA and employee satisfaction. Represent WFM in leadership discussions by preparing and presenting scheduling insights, metrics, and recommendations to senior stakeholders—ensuring visibility into workforce performance and tradeoffs. Here’s what we're looking for: 5+ years of Workforce Management experience supporting a multi-channel, multi-line-of-business contact center, including back-office staffing and support functions. Proven expertise in end-to-end scheduling management, including planning, optimization, and intraday alignment to forecast and service-level goals. Hands-on experience with NICE IEX (or similar WFM systems) for schedule creation, maintenance, and reporting across complex business environments. Strong analytical and technical skills with proficiency in Tableau, Business Intelligence (BI) tools, and SQL—capable of building dashboards, extracting data, and translating insights into operational recommendations. Demonstrated exposure to or experience leveraging AI-driven workforce optimization tools, automation, or predictive analytics to enhance scheduling efficiency and accuracy. Advanced proficiency in Google Workspace (Sheets, Docs, Slides) or Microsoft Excel (pivot tables, formulas, scenario modeling) for WFM analytics and reporting. Exceptional communication and presentation skills, with the ability to effectively synthesize complex data and confidently present findings and recommendations to senior leadership and cross-functional partners. Proven ability to collaborate and influence across functions, building strong partnerships with Forecasting, Intraday, Operations, and Vendor teams to ensure cohesive workforce strategies. Highly organized, detail-oriented, and disciplined—able to manage multiple priorities, maintain accuracy under tight timelines, and deliver consistently in a fast-paced environment. Demonstrated commitment to process improvement and standardization, leveraging technology and best practices to enhance scheduling accuracy, transparency, and team alignment. Our cash compensation amount for this role is $105,000/yearly to $129,00/yearly in Denver and most remote locations, and $127,000/yearly to $156,000/yearly in San Francisco and New York.

Pacing, sound, motion, and color aren’t finishing touches—they’re the work.

You’ll make judgment calls about pacing, sound, animation, and color. You’ll collaborate closely with other creatives and cross-functional partners on our marketing team to produce great work that defines our brand and that has an impact. And you’ll help us raise the bar while also making the work easier to scale—through better workflows, smarter templates, and mindful use of modern tools.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you’re energized by being close to the work, care deeply about taste, and enjoy improving both the output &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the process, this role will be a top-notch fit.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s what you’ll do day-to-day&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Edit brand films, product stories, interviews, explainers, and social-first content&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Design motion graphics, typography, transitions, and animation that serve the story—not the other way around&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Shape expressive arcs through pacing, sound design, and color&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Partner closely with other creatives and cross-functional partners from our marketing, comms and social teams from rough cut through final delivery&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build repeatable templates and workflows that enable faster turnaround without sacrificing quality&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Use modern editing and motion tools—including AI-enabled workflows—to explore, iterate, and produce more proficiently&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Keep post-production organized and deliver final assets that meet creative and technical standards&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s what we’re looking for&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;8+ years of experience editing and designing motion for brand, film, agency, or content studios&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Expert-level fluency in editing and motion tools, with curiosity and judgment around emerging AI-enabled methods&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A portfolio that demonstrates robust storytelling, mindful motion design, and range across formats&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Sharp instincts for sound design, pacing, color, and transitions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Comfort shifting between polished, narrative-driven work and fast, social-first content&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Proficient collaboration skills across creative, production, and marketing partners&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A maker mindset—you enjoy improving how work gets made, not just making the work itself&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compensation Details&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;At Gusto, we strive to provide rewards that empower employees to achieve their financial and personal goals.
