But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

Our total compensation package for full-time employees includes equity, benefits, and may include incentive compensation.Annual Salary:$200,000 - $260,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research.

And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re looking for an experienced engineering leader to lead our Desktop Engineering team. This key leadership role requires deep expertise in desktop application development and a strong product focus to deliver innovative AI-powered experiences to our users. You&#39;ll be responsible for building a high-performing engineering team focused on creating elegant, cross-platform desktop applications that put the power of our AI capabilities at users&#39; fingertips.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You&#39;ll lead engineers working with a mix of native and web technologies to create the best possible version of Claude for macOS and Windows, bridging our AI technology with intuitive user interfaces that transform how people engage with advanced language models.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Today, our app is mostly web-based, but we&#39;re heavily investing in native code and deeper integrations into the operating systems. This means your team will work across multiple programming languages and platforms—from Chromium and Electron to C++ and native macOS and Windows APIs. You&#39;ll work closely with engineers, researchers, and product specialists to shape both the technical direction and the team culture from the ground up. This role requires deep expertise in desktop application development, strong product instincts, and a track record of building teams that deliver innovative, cross-platform experiences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Lead a high-performing team of desktop application engineers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Define and execute the technical strategy for our desktop product initiatives, including architecture decisions and development frameworks&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Create clarity and direction for the team in a fast-moving, ambiguous environment&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Guide and navigate a web-first organization, educating and collaborating with design and product partners to build novel and delightful experiences on top of the entire operating system&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Take an inclusive, equitable approach to hiring and coaching technical talent, guiding both highly independent senior engineers as well as junior engineers learning how to be productive in ambiguity&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You may be a good fit if you have:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;5+ years of experience as a product-minded engineering manager, with experience leading desktop application development teams&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Strong technical background in software development with proven success building and shipping desktop applications&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience with Electron and native desktop technologies&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Track record of recruiting, scaling, and retaining engineering talent in a high-growth environment&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Excellent leadership and communication skills, with ability to work effectively across functions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Demonstrated success in building a culture of belonging and engineering excellence&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re more interested in strong engineering leaders who can build teams excited to learn new technologies than we are looking for someone with hands-on experience in every technology in our stack.

    "description": "&lt;div class=&quot;content-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Anthropic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;About the role:&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic’s performance and scaling teams focus on making the most efficient and impactful use of our compute resources, be it inference or training.&amp;nbsp; As an Engineering Manager on these teams you will be responsible for ensuring you and your team are identifying and removing bottlenecks, building robust and durable solutions, and maximizing the efficiency of our systems.&amp;nbsp; You also will help bring clarity, focus, and context to your teams in a fast paced, dynamic environment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Responsibilities:&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Provide front-line leadership of engineering efforts to improve model performance and scale our inference and training systems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Become familiar with the team’s technical stack enough to make targeted contributions as an individual contributor&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Manage day-to-day execution of the team&#39;s work&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Prioritize the team’s work and manage projects in a highly dynamic, fast paced environment&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Coach and support your reports in understanding, and pursuing, their professional growth&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Maintain a deep understanding of the team&#39;s technical work and its implications for AI safety&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;You may be a good fit if you:&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have 1+ years of management experience in a technical environment, particularly performance or distributed systems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have a background in machine learning, AI, or a similar related technical field&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are deeply interested in the potential transformative effects of advanced AI systems and are committed to ensuring their safe development&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Excel at building strong relationships with stakeholders at all levels&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are a quick learner, capable of understanding and contributing to discussions on complex technical topics&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have experience managing teams through periods of rapid growth and change&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are a quick study: this team sits at the intersection of a large number of different complex technical systems that you’ll need to understand (at a high level of abstraction) to be effective&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Strong candidates may also have experience with:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;High performance, large-scale ML systems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;GPU/Accelerator programming&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;ML framework internals&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;OS internals&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Language modeling with transformers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expected&amp;nbsp;base compensation for this position is below. Our total compensation package for full-time employees includes equity, benefits, and may include incentive compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Annual Salary:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-range&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$425,000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;divider&quot;&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;$560,000 USD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logistics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education requirements: &lt;/strong&gt;We require at least a Bachelor&#39;s degree in a related field or equivalent experience.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Location-based hybrid policy:&lt;/strong&gt; Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",
