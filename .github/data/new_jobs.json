This is a second-line leadership role leading 12 People Empowerers (managers) and ~115 individual contributors. You will play a pivotal role in shaping how Gusto supports prospects and customers during onboarding, driving operational excellence, and ensuring our sales and onboarding teams deliver consistently outstanding experiences. This is an opportunity to be at the forefront of innovation leveraging AI and other digital-first onboarding solutions, driving efficiency and effectiveness for SMB prospects. Additionally, this leader will evolve our onboarding and implementation services for mid-market and Enterprise clients, ensuring consistent partnership and collaboration to deliver seamless migrations to Gusto’s people platform. This leader will be an active Amplifier of Gusto's AI-native strategy, directly shaping how our high-volume services use emerging technology for both scale and quality. About the Team The Onboarding Center of Excellence (OCE) team sits within Subscription Sales and is focused on helping new customers onboard successfully. The team covers: Jr. Onboarding: High-velocity inbound phone and chat support for Direct and Gusto Pro (GPro) prospects. Onboarding Associates: Outbound support for dedicated seller prospects. Specialized Onboarding: Implementations and high Annual Contract Value (ACV) pod support. Senior Onboarding: Solution engineering and enterprise sales support. Our mission is to deliver seamless, scalable onboarding experiences that empower customers and sellers alike. Here’s what you’ll do day-to-day Lead and coach a team of 12 People Empowerers managing ~115 onboarding specialists. Drive excellence across inbound, outbound, specialized, and enterprise onboarding functions. Foster a culture of accountability, continuous improvement, and customer-first problem-solving. Partner cross-functionally with Growth, Revenue Operations, Sales, Partnerships, and Marketing to streamline processes and drive growth. Leverage data and reporting tools to identify opportunities, measure impact, and improve team efficiency and effectiveness. Champion new ideas and solutions, helping shape the future of onboarding at Gusto by ushering in new AI capabilities. You will act as an Amplifier by defining and communicating new standards for service efficiency and quality across the entire onboarding team. Proactively embed AI into core workflows (e.g., automated response generation, data validation, and agent support tools). You must establish and coach best practices for the 4Gs across the team: Give it to AI: Use AI for high-volume, low-risk, repeatable tasks so people can focus on judgment, relationships, and outcomes. Guide the AI: Provide clear context, goals, tone, and examples so outputs are useful, on-brand, and aligned. Grade the Output: Treat AI as a first draft: verify accuracy, completeness, tone, compliance, and fairness before using or sharing. Guard the Trust: Protect privacy and security; earn confidence through transparency, quality, and ethical use. Model Gusto values by empowering people, encouraging dissenting opinions, and ensuring all voices are heard. Here’s what we're looking for 10+ years of relevant Operations experience (GTM Ops, Product Ops, Implementation, Professional Services), including 5+ years leading teams and leaders, with a track record of building high-performing organizations and driving operational transformation at scale. Deep experience building and scaling onboarding and implementation organizations, including designing AI-driven onboarding journeys, chat-based support, personalized recommendations, and dynamic prospect flows. Experience overseeing key strategic levers such as incentive redesign, routing and prioritization logic, channel depth strategy, and workflow optimization to improve speed-to-value and conversion. Bias to action and exceptional cross-functional partnership, able to collaborate closely with Growth, PMM, Workforce Management, CX, Sales, and Product teams to deliver a best-in-class, AI-first onboarding motion across both digital and human-assisted touchpoints. Comfortable navigating competing priorities, aligning stakeholders, and accelerating decision-making. AI fluency and intellectual curiosity, with a demonstrated interest in learning, experimenting, and applying AI solutions to improve onboarding efficiency, accuracy, personalization, and customer outcomes. Able to partner with product and engineering teams to define requirements and test new AI capabilities. Strong initiative and ownership, with a history of anticipating needs, identifying operational gaps, and leading high-impact initiatives end-to-end—from incentive structure modernization to routing and prioritization enhancements, lead-to-onboard flow redesign, and cross-channel strategy evolution. Advanced critical thinking and constructive dissent, skilled at spotting the root cause of performance issues, challenging assumptions with clarity and data, and proposing actionable solutions that improve throughput, quality, and customer experience. High accountability and a drive for excellence, proven in fast-paced, dynamic, or high-growth environments. Maintains elevated standards for team performance, operational predictability, and customer-facing outcomes. Experience building, adapting, and scaling sales and onboarding teams, including hiring, training, coaching, and evolving team structures to fit changing product, channel, or customer needs. Familiarity with optimizing channel depth (digital, inside sales, outbound, franchises, accountants, BD) to ensure prospects and customers receive the right level of interaction at the right time.
