We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco.

    "job_description": "About Loop Loop is the data platform for the global supply chain. Logistics runs on messy, unstructured data—trapped in PDFs, emails, and legacy systems. We use AI to structure this chaos, creating a \"source of truth\" that automates payments and audits for the Fortune 100. We are building the financial nervous system for a $100 trillion physical economy. Our technology ensures freight moves efficiently and carriers get paid instantly. Backed by Founders Fund, Index Ventures and 8VC, we are scaling rapidly. We are looking for engineers ready to deploy production AI that powers the physical economy. What makes AI at Loop unique? We train proprietary foundation models on a massive, unique dataset: hundreds of millions of freight invoices. This data advantage allows us to build agents capable of genuine reasoning, not just text prediction. Our systems use multi-turn logic and external tools to handle the chaos of real-world logistics. We automate the difficult edge cases: extracting data from low-quality scans, reconciling inconsistent vendor files, and allocating complex costs. This is deep technical research applied directly to the physical economy. About the New Grad Program Most AI stays in the browser. Ours moves atoms. You aren't just building features; you are building the autonomous brain for the Fortune 100’s global supply chain. This program is designed to compress 3 years of learning into 1 year by throwing you into the deep end of production AI systems on Day 1. Instead of sandboxed projects, you get to solve real problems and impact customers directly. This program demands intense investment, but by the end, you will perform as a strong entry-level engineer jumpstarting your career. The Schedule: Week 1 (Onboarding): Deep dive into tools and domain. You will ship code to production on Day 1 and fully grasp our dev loop by Friday. Months 1-3 (Velocity): You will deliver 3 entry-level projects with increasing ambiguity. By the end of Month 3, you are expected to operate as a fully independent engineer. Months 4-9 (The Rotation): You will rotate onto a different high-impact team to expand your surface area. Tracks include: Infrastructure: Scaling our training and inference architecture Platform: Building AI and full stack tooling for all of Loop Agents: Designing agents to solve critical workflows Modeling: Improving our foundation model for new use cases Special Projects: Partnering directly with the CEO/CTO and other execs Month 9+ (Graduation): You should demonstrate Mid-Level Engineer performance and will be considered for immediate promotion. About You We are not looking for just “straight-A students.\" We are looking for obsessive builders with spikes. If the following resonates, you belong here: You build on nights and weekends. You have a repo, a side hustle, or a project you built just because you were curious. You don't wait for class assignments to write code.You hate waiting for approval. You prefer to ship, break, fix, and apologize rather than wait for a committee decision. You are bored by easy tasks. You want problems that are more than 1 prompt away from a solution. You grind to win. You are the type to skip social events just to climb the Esports ladder, ace a math competition, or debug a complex issue—purely for the joy of mastery. Responsibilities Ship critical infrastructure. Manage real-world logistics and financial data for the largest enterprise in the world.. Own the why. Build deep context through customer calls, and understand the Loop’s value to our customers. You push back on requirements if you see a better, faster way to solve the customer’s problem. AI proficiency. Work across system boundaries, from full-stack development to LLM agents to foundation models. Leverage AI tools to handle the 90% boilerplate, so you can focus the highest leverage 10%: quality, architecture, product taste. Raise the velocity bar. You will constantly optimize our dev loops, refactor legacy patterns, automate your own workflows and fix broken processes, using AI to push the boundaries. Qualifications Graduating with a BS or higher in STEM fields; available to start full-time in 2026. Working in person in the SF or NYC office 4 days a week. Proficiency with modern techstack. You can deliver a modern web app in hours not in days.. Unblocking yourself. You thrive in ambiguity. Despite the chaos, you deliver high quality products and business impact. AI Literate. You have strong intuition on how LLM works: where they excel and where they generate slop.
