    "job_description": "APM is a critical part of Datadog’s observability platform. It’s where developers go to understand how their services behave in production. But observability doesn’t start in the UI; it starts at the edge: when telemetry is generated in-process and delivered in a way that’s consistent, reliable, and extensible across every service, language, and runtime. That’s where the APM SDK Capabilities team comes in. This team builds the core infrastructure that underpins all our tracing libraries: from configuration systems and startup-time validation to extension points and APIs that work seamlessly across both Datadog-native and OpenTelemetry-based instrumentation. Their work enables product features across the entire APM suite while keeping the developer experience smooth, consistent, and predictable, no matter which language or framework our customers use. As the Engineering Manager for APM SDK Capabilities, you’ll lead a senior, polyglot team working at the heart of Datadog’s instrumentation strategy. You’ll partner with APM and OpenTelemetry product teams, guide technical direction across multiple language SDKs, and help shape how thousands of engineering teams onboard and scale observability with Datadog. You’ll work cross-functionally with teams to ensure that instrumentation isn’t just powerful, but also easy to adopt and built to last. We’re looking for an experienced engineering leader who thrives at the intersection of infrastructure and developer experience.
