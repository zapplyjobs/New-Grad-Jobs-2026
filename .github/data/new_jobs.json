Deep understanding and practical experience with agile/scrum methodologies and a track record of successfully facilitating sprints and managing program backlogs. Exceptional program management skills, including planning, execution, risk management, and stakeholder communication for complex, multi-faceted initiatives.

Excellent analytical and problem-solving skills with the ability to synthesize complex information from different sources (Data, Quality, WFM) into actionable execution plans. Proficiency in project management and agile tools (e.g., Jira, Asana, NotionAI). Experience in contact center operations or Workforce Management (WFM) environments is a strong plus.

With teams in Denver, San Francisco, and New York, we’re proud to support more than 400,000 small businesses across the country, and we’re building a workplace that represents and celebrates the customers we serve. Learn more about our Total Rewards philosophy. About the Role: Gusto is seeking an experienced Workforce Scheduling / Intraday Team Lead who thrives on strategic thinking and solving complex contact center challenges. Reporting into the Workforce Management (WFM) team, you will play a critical role in scaling operations to support Gusto’s next phase of growth. While this role does not have formal direct reports, it carries strong leadership influence. You will serve as the scheduling subject-matter expert, process owner, trainer, and primary point of contact for multi–line-of-business scheduling operations. Lead and optimize scheduling across multiple lines of business, ensuring alignment between forecasts, staffing, skill mix, shift design, and service-level goals. Act as the primary point of contact for scheduling-related questions, decisions, and escalations, especially when management is unavailable. Own and maintain scheduling documentation, including procedures, job aids, governance guidelines, escalation protocols, and version-controlled process flows. Drive continuous improvement by identifying inefficiencies, standardizing practices, and recommending automation or tooling enhancements. Ensure operational readiness for staffing changes, training blocks, peak events, special projects, and business transitions by anticipating impacts and adjusting schedules to maintain service levels and employee engagement. About the Team: You’ll partner closely with WFM analytics, operations leadership, HR/training, and vendor or agency partners to ensure scheduling strategies support business goals and a strong customer experience. Provide training, guidance, and mentorship to schedulers, WFM peers, and operations stakeholders to ensure clarity on scheduling processes, tools, and change controls. Collaborate with WFM analytics and operations leaders to deliver insights on scheduling performance, including forecasting accuracy, schedule adherence, occupancy, shrinkage, and staffing variances. Prepare dashboards and executive-ready summaries and present findings to senior leadership. Facilitate cross-functional coordination to align scheduling strategy with customer experience standards and workforce needs. Here’s what you’ll do day-to-day: Own the end-to-end scheduling process for all supported lines of business—translating forecast and staffing plans into optimized schedules that balance operational efficiency, employee experience, and service level attainment. Serve as the primary point of contact (POC) for all scheduling-related escalations, change requests, and optimization opportunities; provide clear guidance and resolution in partnership with Real-Time Management and Operations. Collaborate cross-functionally with Forecasting, Intraday Management, Operations, and Vendor Management to ensure cohesive workforce strategies that align with business priorities and evolving support needs. Lead weekly scheduling and staffing reviews, bringing forward data-driven insights on performance-to-plan, shrinkage trends, and schedule adherence; facilitate informed decision-making among WFM and Operations partners. Provide peer-level mentorship and training to schedulers, fostering consistency, accuracy, and adoption of best practices in alignment with SWPP scheduling standards. Act as a knowledge resource for tools, systems, and governance protocols. Analyze schedule efficiency, shrinkage, and coverage trends, identifying gaps or inefficiencies; recommend and implement data-informed improvements to enhance utilization, flexibility, and service delivery. Partner with WFM leadership to design and refine scheduling policies, procedures, and automation strategies—driving innovation and standardization across the scheduling discipline. Maintain and continuously improve documentation for scheduling workflows, standards, templates, and change control processes—ensuring clarity, audit readiness, and cross-team alignment. Support operational readiness by proactively planning for peak events, business changes, and special projects; anticipate impacts and adjust schedules to maintain SLA and employee satisfaction. Represent WFM in leadership discussions by preparing and presenting scheduling insights, metrics, and recommendations to senior stakeholders—ensuring visibility into workforce performance and tradeoffs. Here’s what we're looking for: 5+ years of Workforce Management experience supporting a multi-channel, multi-line-of-business contact center, including back-office staffing and support functions. Proven expertise in end-to-end scheduling management, including planning, optimization, and intraday alignment to forecast and service-level goals. Hands-on experience with NICE IEX (or similar WFM systems) for schedule creation, maintenance, and reporting across complex business environments. Strong analytical and technical skills with proficiency in Tableau, Business Intelligence (BI) tools, and SQL—capable of building dashboards, extracting data, and translating insights into operational recommendations. Demonstrated exposure to or experience leveraging AI-driven workforce optimization tools, automation, or predictive analytics to enhance scheduling efficiency and accuracy. Advanced proficiency in Google Workspace (Sheets, Docs, Slides) or Microsoft Excel (pivot tables, formulas, scenario modeling) for WFM analytics and reporting. Exceptional communication and presentation skills, with the ability to effectively synthesize complex data and confidently present findings and recommendations to senior leadership and cross-functional partners. Proven ability to collaborate and influence across functions, building strong partnerships with Forecasting, Intraday, Operations, and Vendor teams to ensure cohesive workforce strategies. Highly organized, detail-oriented, and disciplined—able to manage multiple priorities, maintain accuracy under tight timelines, and deliver consistently in a fast-paced environment. Demonstrated commitment to process improvement and standardization, leveraging technology and best practices to enhance scheduling accuracy, transparency, and team alignment. Our cash compensation amount for this role is $105,000/yearly to $129,00/yearly in Denver and most remote locations, and $127,000/yearly to $156,000/yearly in San Francisco and New York.
