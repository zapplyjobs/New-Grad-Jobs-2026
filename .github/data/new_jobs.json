Experiments such as the Askaryan Radio Array (ARA) and the future radio component of IceCube-Gen2 at the South Pole and the Radio Neutrino Observatory in Greenland (RNO-G) search for EeV-scale neutrinos with antennas deployed in polar ice. Balloon-borne experiments like the Payload for Ultra-high-Energy Observations (PUEO) search for neutrino interactions in the ice and upgoing tau neutrinos from a high altitude. Researchers in the Wissel lab are also exploring novel concepts like the Beamforming Elevated Array for Cosmic Neutrinos which searches for upgoing tau neutrinos from a high-elevation mountain. Previous experience in these experiments or related experiments is advantageous, but not required. The postdoctoral scholar will conduct research on PUEO, which is expected to launch from McMurdo in 2024. For PUEO, the Penn State group is responsible for a deployable array of antenna and calibration systems. The payload will be integrated in Chicago and in Palestine, Tx prior to launch and the postdoc will be expected to contribute to building and testing instrumentation on the PUEO instrument. They will also travel to contribute to integration activities and may conduct field work in Antarctica. As a member of the PUEO team, they will contribute to searches for the highest energy neutrinos in the flight data.Penn State is a vibrant and stimulating environment for particle and multi-messenger astrophysics with ample opportunities for collaboration and career development. The postdoctoral scholar will be embedded within the Particle Astrophysics group and the Center for Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (CMA) at the Institute for Gravitation and the Cosmos (IGC).
