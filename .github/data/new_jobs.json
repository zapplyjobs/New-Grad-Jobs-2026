We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems. About the Role Reward models are a critical component of how we align our AI systems with human values and preferences, serving as the bridge between human feedback and model behavior. In this role, you'll build the infrastructure that enables us to train reward models efficiently and reliably, scale to increasingly large model sizes, and incorporate diverse forms of human feedback across multiple domains and modalities. You will own the end-to-end engineering of reward model training at Anthropic. You'll work at the intersection of machine learning systems and alignment research, partnering closely with researchers to translate novel techniques into production-grade training pipelines. This is a high-impact role where your work directly contributes to making Claude more helpful, harmless, and honest. Note: For this role, we conduct all interviews in Python. Responsibilities: Own the end-to-end engineering of reward model training, from data ingestion through model evaluation and deployment Design and implement efficient, reliable training pipelines that can scale to increasingly large model sizes Build robust data pipelines for collecting, processing, and incorporating human feedback into reward model training Optimize training infrastructure for throughput, efficiency, and fault tolerance across distributed systems Extend reward model capabilities to support new domains and additional data modalities Collaborate with researchers to implement and iterate on novel reward modeling techniques Develop tooling and monitoring systems to ensure training quality and identify issues early Contribute to the design and improvement of our overall model training infrastructure You may be a good fit if you: Have significant experience building and maintaining large-scale ML systems Are proficient in Python and have experience with ML frameworks such as PyTorch Have experience with distributed training systems and optimizing ML workloads for efficiency Are comfortable working with large datasets and building data pipelines at scale Can balance research exploration with engineering rigor and operational reliability Enjoy collaborating closely with researchers and translating research ideas into reliable engineering systems Are results-oriented with a bias towards flexibility and impact Can navigate ambiguity and make progress in fast-moving research environments Adapt quickly to changing priorities, while juggling multiple urgent issues Maintain clarity when debugging complex, time-sensitive issues Pick up slack, even if it goes outside your job description Care about the societal impacts of your work and are motivated by Anthropic's mission Strong candidates may also have experience with Training or fine-tuning large language models Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or related techniques GPUs, Kubernetes, and cloud infrastructure (AWS, GCP) Building systems for human-in-the-loop machine learning Working with multimodal data (text, images, audio, etc.) Large-scale ETL and data processing frameworks (Spark, Airflow) Representative projects Scaling reward model training to handle models with significantly more parameters while maintaining training stability Building a unified data pipeline that ingests human feedback from multiple sources and formats for reward model training Implementing fault-tolerant training infrastructure that gracefully handles hardware failures during long training runs Developing evaluation frameworks to measure reward model quality across diverse domains Optimizing training throughput to reduce iteration time on reward modeling experiments The annual compensation range for this role is below. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. Our total compensation package for full-time employees includes equity and benefits.Annual Salary:$350,000 - $500,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time.

It’s our job to help improve developer efficiency by providing libraries/APIs/frameworks, monitoring performance, building shared components, improving build tools, etc. In the codebase, we own the core components of the app such as the networking and caching stack.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We set the direction in which the codebase builds towards by defining which design patterns and technologies to employ at Reddit. As Reddit’s greater engineering team scales up, Apps Platform is also responsible for innovating and building new processes and methods to continuously support a greater number of customers without linearly scaling the team size as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What We Are Looking For&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Expertise in Java or Kotlin with 5+ years of experience within Android development.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Sound software engineering fundamentals.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Embracing the challenges of building data intensive, highly responsive, and fault tolerant apps in the constrained environment of a smartphone.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Willingness to buck trends and learn new ways to build software.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Passion for developing scalable, well-designed software that improves people’s lives globally.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience building at least one amazing Android app with a team from start to shipment.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build experiences and create the patterns for Reddit’s official Android app that improve our core flows like browsing posts, commenting and creating content.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Partner across product, design, and engineering teams to innovate and implement sophisticated solutions to complex challenges.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Participate in the full Android development cycle: design, develop, QA, experiment, analyze, and deploy.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p data-renderer-start-pos=&quot;3243&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li data-renderer-start-pos=&quot;5039&quot; data-local-id=&quot;7a8141b5-f7ba-4353-bdee-caf575fee079&quot;&gt;Comprehensive Healthcare Benefits and Income Replacement Programs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li data-renderer-start-pos=&quot;5108&quot; data-local-id=&quot;7a8141b5-f7ba-4353-bdee-caf575fee079&quot;&gt;401k with Employer Match&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li data-renderer-start-pos=&quot;5136&quot; data-local-id=&quot;7a8141b5-f7ba-4353-bdee-caf575fee079&quot;&gt;Global Benefit programs that fit your lifestyle, from workspace to professional development to caregiving support&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li data-renderer-start-pos=&quot;5253&quot; data-local-id=&quot;7a8141b5-f7ba-4353-bdee-caf575fee079&quot;&gt;Family Planning Support&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li data-renderer-start-pos=&quot;5280&quot; data-local-id=&quot;7a8141b5-f7ba-4353-bdee-caf575fee079&quot;&gt;Gender-Affirming Care&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li data-renderer-start-pos=&quot;5305&quot; data-local-id=&quot;7a8141b5-f7ba-4353-bdee-caf575fee079&quot;&gt;Mental Health &amp;amp; Coaching Benefits&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li data-renderer-start-pos=&quot;5342&quot; data-local-id=&quot;7a8141b5-f7ba-4353-bdee-caf575fee079&quot;&gt;Flexible Vacation &amp;amp; Paid Volunteer Time Off&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li data-renderer-start-pos=&quot;5389&quot; data-local-id=&quot;7a8141b5-f7ba-4353-bdee-caf575fee079&quot;&gt;Generous Paid Parental Leave&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pay Transparency:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This job posting may span more than one career level.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In addition to base salary, this job is eligible to receive equity in the form of restricted stock units, and depending on the position offered, it may also be eligible to receive a commission.
