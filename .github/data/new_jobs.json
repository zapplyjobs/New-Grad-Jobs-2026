We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.

We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

    "job_description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the role: The IT Operations team keeps Anthropic running — we make sure every employee can do their best work without friction. We're seeking an IT Support Engineer who combines deep technical skills with a genuine service mindset and sound judgment. Anthropic is growing fast, and our IT operations need to keep pace. That means onboarding at scale, automating repetitive processes (including with Claude), and continuously improving the employee experience. You'll handle support challenges across our primarily macOS environment while contributing to the operational improvements that help us scale. You'll work closely with IT Engineering and Security, with opportunities to grow into more technical infrastructure work over time. Responsibilities End-User Support Triage and resolve issues across hardware, software, networking, and accounts — primarily through our ticketing system, with additional support via Slack and in-person Diagnose and resolve issues across macOS, ChromeOS, iOS, Android, and our core SaaS platforms (Google Workspace, Slack, GitHub, Atlassian) Troubleshoot device issues, including enrollment, configuration profiles, and policy enforcement Support access management and employee lifecycle workflows (onboarding, offboarding, reorgs) Handle escalations requiring cross-team coordination Participate in an on-call rotation for urgent issues outside business hours Provide hands-on support for user technology, AV systems, conference rooms, and printers Communication & Documentation Communicate clearly with users of all technical levels Write and maintain internal documentation including runbooks, how-to guides, and knowledge base articles Identify patterns in support requests, surface recurring issues to the team, and identify opportunities for automation or systemic solves Operational Improvement Help streamline onboarding and other high-volume operations as the company scales Contribute to automation efforts Maintain and improve device management, identity, and access systems Assist with scripting (Bash, Python) to automate repetitive tasks You may be a good fit if you Have 5-7+ years of hands-on IT support experience, ideally in a fast-paced or high-growth environment Are an excellent communicator who genuinely enjoys helping people solve problems Have strong troubleshooting skills and are methodical, curious, and persistent Demonstrated supporting macOS endpoints and comfortable supporting ChromeOS, iOS, and Android Have significant experience with Google Workspace administration Have experience with Slack administration — workspace management, permissions, and troubleshooting Have substantial experience supporting and administering additional SaaS tools Understand identity and access fundamentals — SSO, MFA, directory services Are familiar with MDM fundamentals and endpoint management concepts Have experience with basic scripting (Bash or Python) for automation Take ownership of problems and follow through until they're resolved Think beyond the immediate fix — you ask \"why did this happen?\" and \"how do we prevent it?\" Are organized enough to manage competing priorities without things falling through the cracks Propose solutions when you see a process that doesn't scale Are looking to develop deeper technical skills and take on more complex systems administration challenges over time Strong candidates may also Be familiar with zero-trust security concepts and endpoint security tooling Have experience with networking basics — DNS, DHCP, VPNs, networking fundamentals Have contributed to IT projects beyond day-to-day support (migrations, tool rollouts, process redesigns) Have experience using AI tools to improve personal or team productivity Location This role is based in one of our offices (San Francisco or New York). We expect you to be in-office 4 days per week during your first few months, with the opportunity to work remotely up to 2 days per week after that. What Makes This Role Unique You'll be joining a high-impact IT team supporting some of the world's leading AI researchers and engineers. The pace is fast and you'll have real ownership over your work. This isn't a role where you follow rigid scripts — you'll be trusted to use your judgment, improve our processes, and grow with the team. Because we're scaling rapidly, you'll have meaningful opportunities to shape how IT operations work at Anthropic. Deadline to apply: None. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis.The annual compensation range for this role is listed below. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.Annual Salary:$170,000 - $230,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the role:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The IT Operations team keeps Anthropic running — we make sure every employee can do their best work without friction. We&#39;re seeking an IT Support Engineer who combines deep technical skills with a genuine service mindset and sound judgment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is growing fast, and our IT operations need to keep pace. That means onboarding at scale, automating repetitive processes (including with Claude), and continuously improving the employee experience. You&#39;ll handle support challenges across our primarily macOS environment while contributing to the operational improvements that help us scale. You&#39;ll work closely with IT Engineering and Security, with opportunities to grow into more technical infrastructure work over time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;End-User Support&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Triage and resolve issues across hardware, software, networking, and accounts — primarily through our ticketing system, with additional support via Slack and in-person&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Diagnose and resolve issues across macOS, ChromeOS, iOS, Android, and our core SaaS platforms (Google Workspace, Slack, GitHub, Atlassian)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Troubleshoot device issues, including enrollment, configuration profiles, and policy enforcement&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Support access management and employee lifecycle workflows (onboarding, offboarding, reorgs)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Handle escalations requiring cross-team coordination&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Participate in an on-call rotation for urgent issues outside business hours&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Provide hands-on support for user technology, AV systems, conference rooms, and printers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communication &amp;amp; Documentation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Communicate clearly with users of all technical levels&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Write and maintain internal documentation including runbooks, how-to guides, and knowledge base articles&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Identify patterns in support requests, surface recurring issues to the team, and identify opportunities for automation or systemic solves&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operational Improvement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Help streamline onboarding and other high-volume operations as the company scales&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Contribute to automation efforts&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Maintain and improve device management, identity, and access systems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Assist with scripting (Bash, Python) to automate repetitive tasks&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;You may be a good fit if you&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have 5-7+ years of hands-on IT support experience, ideally in a fast-paced or high-growth environment&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are an excellent communicator who genuinely enjoys helping people solve problems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have strong troubleshooting skills and are methodical, curious, and persistent&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Demonstrated supporting macOS endpoints and comfortable supporting ChromeOS, iOS, and Android&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have significant experience with Google Workspace administration&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have experience with Slack administration — workspace management, permissions, and troubleshooting&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have substantial experience supporting and administering additional SaaS tools&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Understand identity and access fundamentals — SSO, MFA, directory services&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are familiar with MDM fundamentals and endpoint management concepts&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have experience with basic scripting (Bash or Python) for automation&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Take ownership of problems and follow through until they&#39;re resolved&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Think beyond the immediate fix — you ask &quot;why did this happen?&quot; and &quot;how do we prevent it?&quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are organized enough to manage competing priorities without things falling through the cracks&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Propose solutions when you see a process that doesn&#39;t scale&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are looking to develop deeper technical skills and take on more complex systems administration challenges over time&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Strong candidates may also&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Be familiar with zero-trust security concepts and endpoint security tooling&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have experience with networking basics — DNS, DHCP, VPNs, networking fundamentals&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have contributed to IT projects beyond day-to-day support (migrations, tool rollouts, process redesigns)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have experience using AI tools to improve personal or team productivity&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Location&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This role is based in one of our offices (San Francisco or New York).

The pace is fast and you&#39;ll have real ownership over your work. This isn&#39;t a role where you follow rigid scripts — you&#39;ll be trusted to use your judgment, improve our processes, and grow with the team. Because we&#39;re scaling rapidly, you&#39;ll have meaningful opportunities to shape how IT operations work at Anthropic.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deadline to apply:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;None.

However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",
