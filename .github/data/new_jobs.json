    "job_description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.Anthropic’s Audio team pushes the boundaries of what's possible with audio with large language models. We care about making safe, steerable, reliable systems that can understand and generate speech and audio, prioritizing not only naturalness but also steerability and robustness. As a researcher on the Audio team, you'll work across the full stack of audio ML, developing audio codecs and representations, sourcing and synthesizing high quality audio data, training large-scale speech language models and large audio diffusion models, and developing novel architectures for incorporating continuous signals into LLMs. Our team focuses primarily but not exclusively on speech, building advanced steerable systems spanning end-to-end conversational systems, speech and audio understanding models, and speech synthesis capabilities. The team works closely with many collaborators across pretraining, finetuning, reinforcement learning, production inference, and product to get advanced audio technologies from early research to high impact real-world deployments. You may be a good fit if you: Have hands-on experience with training audio models, whether that's conversational speech-to-speech, speech translation, speech recognition, text-to-speech, diarization, codecs, or generative audio models Genuinely enjoy both research and engineering work, and you'd describe your ideal split as roughly 50/50 rather than heavily weighted toward one or the other Are comfortable working across abstraction levels, from signal processing fundamentals to large-scale model training and inference optimization Have deep expertise with JAX, PyTorch, or large-scale distributed training, and can debug performance issues across the full stack Thrive in fast-moving environments where the most important problem might shift as we learn more about what works Communicate clearly and collaborate effectively; audio touches many parts of our systems, so you'll work closely with teams across the company Are passionate about building conversational AI that feels natural, steerable, and safe Care about the societal impacts of voice AI and want to help shape how these systems are developed responsibly Strong candidates may also have experience with: Large language model pretraining and finetuning Training diffusion models for image and audio generation Reinforcement learning for large language models and diffusion models End-to-end system optimization, from performance benchmarking to kernel optimization GPUs, Kubernetes, PyTorch, or distributed training infrastructure Representative projects: Training state-of-the art neural audio codecs for 48 kHz stereo audio Developing novel algorithms for diffusion pretraining and reinforcement learning Scaling audio datasets to millions of hours of high quality audio Creating robust evaluation methodologies for hard-to-measure qualities such as naturalness or expressiveness Studying training dynamics of mixed audio-text language models Optimizing latency and inference throughput for deployed streaming audio systems The annual compensation range for this role is listed below. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.Annual Salary:$350,000 - $500,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

    "job_description": "About Vercel: Vercel gives developers the tools and cloud infrastructure to build, scale, and secure a faster, more personalized web. As the team behind v0, Next.js, and AI SDK, Vercel helps customers like Ramp, Supreme, PayPal, and Under Armour build for the AI-native web. Our mission is to enable the world to ship the best products. That starts with creating a place where everyone can do their best work. Whether you're building on our platform, supporting our customers, or shaping our story: You can just ship things.About Startups @ Vercel The Vercel Startups org exists to help founders navigate the shift to AI-native development with confidence. Startups move faster than ever—what used to take years now happens in days—and the decisions founders make early can either unlock scale or become long-term constraints. We partner with startups at the critical moments where technical, commercial, and strategic support starts to matter most. We’re a talent-dense team made up of former founders, engineers, and experienced go-to-market operators who bring firsthand experience building, scaling, and supporting modern software companies. Many of us have sat on the other side of the table, making architectural decisions, navigating tradeoffs, and scaling under real constraints, and we bring that perspective into every customer interaction. We operate with a growth mindset and strong shared ownership. We dig deep to understand our customers, work closely across functions as one team, and find ways to win even when the path forward isn’t obvious. Resilience, curiosity, and a willingness to push through hard problems are table stakes here. This is a team for people who want to operate with high trust, high agency, and high impact — alongside peers who care deeply about helping startups succeed. About The Role You are an expert in Vercel, you have incredible pattern recognition, and are at the bleeding edge of the tech and tools defining how we live and work. In this role, you'll help startups unlock Vercel's full value from adoption through scaling—building relationships with founders and technical leaders who are making critical architectural decisions. You'll analyze usage patterns to identify expansion opportunities, coordinate cross-functional teams to drive outcomes, and guide teams as they adopt AI-native architectures. By leveraging automation and AI to maximize your impact, you'll help refine early plays into repeatable playbooks that scale across our startup portfolio.If you’re based within commuting distance of our London office, the role includes in-office anchor days. What You Will Do Build trusted relationships with founders, developers, and technical leaders by quickly developing deep understanding of their architecture, use cases, and technical constraints Landing new logos, driving early activation, and making Vercel the default choice before competitors get in Driving first activation, earning trust fast, and positioning Vercel as the obvious default stack Focus on pipeline generation, outbound, identifying high-potential startups early Partner with founders and developers as they adopt AI-native features and architectures, helping them understand how Vercel’s Frontend Cloud fits into a rapidly evolving developer ecosystem and supports new workloads, performance requirements, and scaling patterns Use automation, agents, and self-built workflows to operate at high leverage and focus time and energy on the most impactful customer work Operate comfortably in an evolving environment, helping refine early motions and turn what works into repeatable playbooks About You We’re looking for someone who sits at the intersection of technical curiosity, commercial excellence, and startup mindset. You identify pattern recognition, have founder empathy, and have the ability to speak credibly to pre-seed through Series D companies and beyond who are making fast decisions. You might be a great fit if you’ve developed this skill set through a range of paths—whether as a builder, founder, engineer, or in a technical go-to-market role—and you bring strong judgment, ownership, and curiosity to how you work. In practice, this looks like someone who: Learns complex technical products quickly and enjoys reasoning about how modern web and AI-native applications are built and scaled Can speak comfortably with developers and founders, using their language and earning credibility through insight rather than titles Has strong sales acumen and experience owning revenue outcomes across a range of deal sizes and complexities Believes that the best revenue outcomes come from deeply successful customers, not transactional selling Brings a thoughtful, opinionated point of view on modern web infrastructure, frontend performance, and scaling tradeoffs Thrives in ambiguity and enjoys shaping how a team and motion evolves from early to more structured Is energized by ownership, accountability, and helping customers make smart decisions What This Role Is Not Not a pure Customer Success role focused on reactive support Not a transactional sales role detached from customer outcomes Not a highly scripted role with narrow ownership or predefined motions This role requires judgment, curiosity, and comfort operating across technical, strategic, and commercial dimensions. Benefits: Competitive compensation package, including equity. Inclusive Healthcare Package. Learn and Grow - we provide mentorship and send you to events that help you build your network and skills. Flexible Time Off. We will provide you the gear you need to do your role, and a WFH budget for you to outfit your space as needed. The San Francisco, CA OTE range for this role is $170,000-$209,000. Actual salary will be based on job-related skills, experience, and location. Compensation outside of San Francisco may be adjusted based on employee location. The total compensation package may include benefits, equity-based compensation, and eligibility for a company bonus or variable pay program depending on the role. Your recruiter can share more details during the hiring process. Vercel is committed to fostering and empowering an inclusive community within our organization.

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems. About the Role We're looking for a Software Engineer to work at the intersection of engineering and research on the Claude Code team. In this role, you'll collaborate directly with Anthropic's researchers to improve Claude’s coding capabilities through tooling, infrastructure, and evaluations. You'll build systems that help us understand where Claude Code excels and where it falls short—and then help close those gaps. We're looking for engineers who can build robust, complex systems and who thrive in fast-paced, high-intensity environments. You'll take ambiguous problems and turn them into reliable infrastructure that accelerates our research. Responsibilities Design and build eval systems that measure model capabilities across diverse coding tasks Build tooling and infrastructure that enables researchers to run experiments at scale Develop pipelines for data collection, processing, and analysis Create internal tools that improve researcher productivity and accelerate iteration cycles Serve as a bridge between product and research—bring strong product intuition to inform which capabilities matter most Work closely with researchers to translate research questions into engineering solutions Own systems end-to-end—from design through production reliability You may be a good fit if you: Have built and owned complex systems—pipelines, infrastructure, or software that orchestrates many components and handles significant state and logic Thrive in high-intensity environments with fast iteration cycles Take full ownership of problems and drive them to completion independently Are a power user of agentic coding tools and have strong intuition about model capabilities and limitations Are comfortable diving into unfamiliar technical domains and figuring things out quickly Care deeply about correctness and reliability in the systems you build Are excited to work at the boundary between engineering and AI research Have at least 5 years of work experience Strong candidates may also have experience with: Writing or maintaining eval frameworks Reinforcement learning systems Working in high-performance, demanding environments—trading firms, quant funds, competitive research labs, or fast-moving startups where intensity is the norm Have research computing or scientific infrastructure background Have a strong quantitative foundation (math, physics, or related fields) Python and TypeScript The annual compensation range for this role is listed below. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.Annual Salary:$320,000 - $485,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day.

At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",
