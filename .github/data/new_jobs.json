    "job_description": "The Advanced Photon Source (APS) (https://www.aps.anl.gov/) at Argonne National Laboratory (Lemont, Illinois, US (near Chicago)) invites applicants for a postdoctoral position to build a physics-informed AI framework that decodes the complex relationships between material defects, functional fields (e.g., strain, electrostatic potential), and device performance, with a primary focus on leveraging advanced synchrotron X-ray techniques. The successful candidate will be at the forefront of integrating cutting-edge AI methodologies with world-leading X-ray characterization. You will develop and apply novel machine learning models—including Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), variational autoencoders, and geometric deep learning—to fuse multimodal data from diverse experimental probes like Bragg Coherent Diffraction Imaging (BCDI), ptychography, and X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (XPCS). The goal is to move beyond simple correlations to discover the causal, governing rules of defect-property relationships in next-generation electronic materials.This role involves creating AI models for real-time data analysis, enabling autonomous experiments through active learning and \"curiosity-driven\" exploration, and contributing to a robust data infrastructure that makes large-scale, multimodal datasets FAIR and AI-ready. You will publish findings in high-impact journals, present at major international conferences, and work within a large, interdisciplinary team of experts from multiple national laboratories and universities.The appointee will benefit from direct access to the unique capabilities of the upgraded APS, leadership-class computing at the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF), and state-of-the-art microscopy at the Center for Nanoscale Materials (CNM).
