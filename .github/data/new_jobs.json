    "description": "ABOUT SUPABASE\n\nSupabase is the Postgres development platform, built by developers for developers. We provide a complete backend solution including Database, Auth, Storage, Edge Functions, Realtime, and Vector Search. All services are deeply integrated and designed for growth.\n\n\nAbout the role\nWe're looking for a Rust Developer to join our team to help innovate on our PostgreSQL projects.\n\nYou'll primarily collaborate with the PostgreSQL tools team and directly contribute to technical choices and internal processes.\n\nThe key tasks associated with this role revolve around Rust development in the PostgreSQL ecosystem. You will work to refine https://github.com/supabase/etl expand our PostgreSQL extensions, develop CLI tooling for the dbdev package index, and assist in the development of several other repositories.\n\nIn this role, you will be mainly responsible for:\n\n - contributing to our Rust repos:\n   \n   - Public Projects https://github.com/supabase/pg_replicate, wrappers https://github.com/supabase/wrappers, pg_graphql https://github.com/supabase/pg_graphql, dbdev https://github.com/supabase/dbdev, pg_jsonschema https://github.com/supabase/pg_jsonschema,\n\n - participating in the successful rollout of pl/rust https://github.com/tcdi/plrust\n\n\nTHIS ROLE REQUIRES FIVE CRITICAL ATTRIBUTES:\n\n 1. You have a strong background in Rust programming. You're well-versed in Rust's unique features and understand how to leverage them to create efficient, reliable software.

Experience with system design and infrastructure: understanding of cloud environments, some knowledge of k8s.\n\n 3. Experience with PostgreSQL. While not strictly necessary, experience with PostgreSQL will be a significant advantage in this role. You may have previously worked with PostgreSQL extensions or used PostgreSQL in a high-performance context.\n\n 4. Ability to self-manage. Every company will expect you to self-manage to some degree, but Supabase takes this to a new level. We are a flat, early-stage startup without a lot of structure. To thrive in this environment, you’ll need to be a motivated self-starter who is good working asynchronously across multiple teams. We’re looking for someone who will identify things that need improvement and put their heads down until it’s shipped.\n\n 5. Basics of Distributed Systems: Understanding of fundamental distributed systems concepts such as consistency, fault tolerance, and distributed consensus. Experience with or knowledge of common distributed system architectures and patterns is a plus.\n\n\nWHAT YOU’LL DO\n\n - Contribute to the development of our Rust projects, refining existing features and developing new ones.\n\n - Participate in the design and development of our PostgreSQL extensions and package index.\n\n - Build tools within the Supabase ecosystem, occasionally dogfooding our own work.\n\n - Interacting with customers on a daily basis.\n\n - Triage and fix GitHub issues.\n\n\nMUST HAVES\n\n - Strong understanding of Rust fundamentals, programming model, and concurrency.\n\n - Ability to independently tackle medium to complex initiatives and share progress clearly.\n\n - Experience with Git and version control practices.\n\n - Willingness to evolve and shape our development tools/stack.\n\n - Willingness to regularly talk to customers to ensure we’re solving problems they have.\n\n - Willingness to work in a fast-paced environment.\n\n\nNICE TO HAVES\n\n - Experience with PostgreSQL as a user and/or extension author.\n\n - Experience with GraphQL.\n\n - Experience working on a large, open-source projects.\n\n - Open source rust contributions.\n\n\nWHAT WE OFFER\n\n - Fully Remote\n   \n   We hire globally.
