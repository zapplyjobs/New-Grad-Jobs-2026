It’s a massive, ambitious opportunity that demands the best of us, every day, as we build the emerging onchain platform — and with it, the future global financial system.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To achieve our mission, we’re seeking a very specific candidate. We want someone who is passionate about our mission and who believes in the power of crypto and blockchain technology to update the financial system. We want someone who is eager to leave their mark on the world, who relishes the pressure and privilege of working with high caliber colleagues, and who actively seeks feedback to keep leveling up. We want someone who will run towards, not away from, solving the company’s hardest problems.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coinbase.com/mission&quot;&gt;work culture&lt;/a&gt; is intense and isn’t for everyone. But if you want to build the future alongside others who excel in their disciplines and expect the same from you, there’s no better place to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While many roles at Coinbase are remote-first, we are not remote-only. In-person participation is required throughout the year. Team and company-wide offsites are held multiple times annually to foster collaboration, connection, and alignment. Attendance is expected and fully supported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Compliance team within Customer Experience (CX) is responsible for developing and delivering best in class support across multiple customer segments.

As a Compliance Support Supervisor, you will lead a team of 10-15 Compliance Analysts responsible for enhanced due diligence (EDD), transaction monitoring, to include preparation and filing of Suspicious Activity Reports (SAR). The supervisor sets a culture of ownership and customer focus on their teams by supporting individual and team goals and ensuring best in class customer service experiences through the team. Supervisors also identify broader customer impacting issues and work with technical and nontechnical teams to implement solutions to drive quality and productivity of operations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you’ll be doing:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Lead a team of 10-15 Compliance (Transaction Monitoring / AML and Fraud Investigations/EDD) Analysts;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ensure adherence to operational KPIs from directs and vendor partners&amp;nbsp; or overall performance and the quality.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Coordinate with senior management and provide insights for process improvement.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Communicate effectively with your team to drive individual and group performance.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Champion change management with your team.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ask the question “How does this create value for customers” when making decision&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Lead a “culture of compliance”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Subject matter expert in AML compliance&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Partner with Financial Crimes and second line compliance partners to execute against Coinbase’s AML program&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we look for in you:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Bachelor&#39;s degree or 3+ years of experience within the Compliance field.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;2-3+ year of supervisory experience&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Working knowledge of financial laws, regulations, and guidelines (e.g., BSA, OFAC, FinCEN guidance)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Positive energy on the future of crypto and Web3&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Excellent communication skills (written and verbal), ability to simplify complex topics for broad audiences&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience working computers and multiple software and database systems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ability to thrive in ambiguous environments&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nice to haves:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Compliance Industry certification (e.g. ACAMS)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Advanced understanding of Google apps&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Project Management, Scrum, Agile, or Lean 6S certification/experience.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with the Coinbase suite of products&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note: This role requires full-time, in-office presence at our Charlotte location.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Job #: G2707&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;#LI-Onsite&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pay Transparency Notice&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Depending on your work location, the target annual &lt;strong&gt;base &lt;/strong&gt;salary for this position can range as detailed below.
