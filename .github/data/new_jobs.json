How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",
