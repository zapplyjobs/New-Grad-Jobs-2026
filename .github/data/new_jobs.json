We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research.

However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

    "job_description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the role Anthropic is looking for a Head of Sales and Partnerships Recruiting to lead recruiting efforts across our Sales and Partnerships organizations. This role will own recruiting across all Sales segments (SDR, Startups, Mid Market, Enterprise, and Strategic) as well as our Global Partnerships organization. You'll manage a team that includes both managers and individual contributors, and serve as a critical partner to our Head of Sales, AMER and Head of Global BD & Partnerships. This role reports to the Global Head of GTM Recruiting. This is a global role. While EMEA and APAC recruiters report into regional leaders, you will own the programmatic elements of Sales and Partnerships recruiting at a global scale, partnering closely with recruiting managers in those regions to drive consistency, share best practices, and ensure we're building a cohesive candidate and hiring manager experience worldwide. We're at an inflection point. Our GTM organization is scaling 3-4x year over year, and we need a leader who can build the systems, processes, and team to support that growth while maintaining an exceptionally high bar for talent. You'll be the connective tissue between regional teams, central operations, and business leadership, ensuring we hire with both speed and precision. Responsibilities Build, lead, and develop a high-performing recruiting team that includes both managers and individual contributors, with a focus on coaching and scaling leadership capability Own the programmatic elements of Sales and Partnerships recruiting globally, partnering with recruiting managers in EMEA and APAC to ensure consistency while allowing for regional flexibility Design and implement end-to-end recruiting processes that are rigorous, measurable, and built for scale Develop headcount forecasting models that tie directly to our revenue plan, enabling predictable hiring aligned to business growth Be obsessed with quality. Champion talent density over talent mass, ensuring every hire raises the bar while still successfully delivering on headcount commitments Partner closely with the Head of Sales, AMER and Head of Global BD & Partnerships as a strategic advisor on talent strategy, market insights, and pipeline health Optimize interview capacity and calibration across hiring teams, ensuring we use interviewer time effectively and maintain consistent evaluation standards Establish clear quality of hire metrics tied to performance outcomes, and use that data to continuously improve sourcing, assessment, and closing strategies Partner closely with our Recruiting Operations team to ensure systems and tools effectively support GTM hiring goals Collaborate with Compensation and HR to ensure our offers are competitive and calibrated to market, particularly for specialized or senior sales and partnerships roles You may be a good fit if you Have 12+ years of recruiting experience with at least 7 years leading teams, including experience managing managers Bring deep expertise in Sales recruiting across multiple segments and understand the nuances of hiring for transactional versus strategic, consultative roles Are genuinely data-obsessed: you build dashboards, track leading indicators, and make decisions based on evidence rather than intuition Lead with low ego and high EQ, building trust across functions and coaching your team through feedback and development rather than directive management Have operated in high-growth environments and know how to build processes that scale without becoming bureaucratic Refuse to sacrifice quality for speed. You understand that talent density is what drives performance, and you hold the line even under pressure Are exceptional at stakeholder management, particularly with senior sales and business development leaders who have strong opinions and high expectations Have experience designing and refining interview processes that are both predictive and efficient Can navigate global complexity, building frameworks that create consistency across regions while respecting local context and partnerships with regional leaders Actively use AI tools like Claude to drive your own productivity and enable your team to do the same Strong candidates may also have Experience partnering with Compensation on market analysis, leveling frameworks, and offer strategy for GTM roles Familiarity with recruiting for AI/ML or technical product companies where the business model and product are evolving rapidly Background in Partnerships or Business Development recruiting, not just Sales A track record of building recruiting forecasting models tied to revenue outcomes and pipeline predictability The annual compensation range for this role is listed below. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.Annual Salary:$295,000 - $360,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

    "description": "&lt;div class=&quot;content-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Anthropic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is looking for a Head of Sales and Partnerships Recruiting to lead recruiting efforts across our Sales and Partnerships organizations. This role will own recruiting across all Sales segments (SDR, Startups, Mid Market, Enterprise, and Strategic) as well as our Global Partnerships organization. You&#39;ll manage a team that includes both managers and individual contributors, and serve as a critical partner to our Head of Sales, AMER and Head of Global BD &amp;amp; Partnerships. This role reports to the Global Head of GTM Recruiting.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a global role. While EMEA and APAC recruiters report into regional leaders, you will own the programmatic elements of Sales and Partnerships recruiting at a global scale, partnering closely with recruiting managers in those regions to drive consistency, share best practices, and ensure we&#39;re building a cohesive candidate and hiring manager experience worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re at an inflection point. Our GTM organization is scaling 3-4x year over year, and we need a leader who can build the systems, processes, and team to support that growth while maintaining an exceptionally high bar for talent. You&#39;ll be the connective tissue between regional teams, central operations, and business leadership, ensuring we hire with both speed and precision.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Build, lead, and develop a high-performing recruiting team that includes both managers and individual contributors, with a focus on coaching and scaling leadership capability&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Own the programmatic elements of Sales and Partnerships recruiting globally, partnering with recruiting managers in EMEA and APAC to ensure consistency while allowing for regional flexibility&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Design and implement end-to-end recruiting processes that are rigorous, measurable, and built for scale&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Develop headcount forecasting models that tie directly to our revenue plan, enabling predictable hiring aligned to business growth&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Be obsessed with quality. Champion talent density over talent mass, ensuring every hire raises the bar while still successfully delivering on headcount commitments&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Partner closely with the Head of Sales, AMER and Head of Global BD &amp;amp; Partnerships as a strategic advisor on talent strategy, market insights, and pipeline health&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Optimize interview capacity and calibration across hiring teams, ensuring we use interviewer time effectively and maintain consistent evaluation standards&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Establish clear quality of hire metrics tied to performance outcomes, and use that data to continuously improve sourcing, assessment, and closing strategies&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Partner closely with our Recruiting Operations team to ensure systems and tools effectively support GTM hiring goals&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Collaborate with Compensation and HR to ensure our offers are competitive and calibrated to market, particularly for specialized or senior sales and partnerships roles&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You may be a good fit if you&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Have 12+ years of recruiting experience with at least 7 years leading teams, including experience managing managers&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Bring deep expertise in Sales recruiting across multiple segments and understand the nuances of hiring for transactional versus strategic, consultative roles&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Are genuinely data-obsessed: you build dashboards, track leading indicators, and make decisions based on evidence rather than intuition&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Lead with low ego and high EQ, building trust across functions and coaching your team through feedback and development rather than directive management&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Have operated in high-growth environments and know how to build processes that scale without becoming bureaucratic&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Refuse to sacrifice quality for speed. You understand that talent density is what drives performance, and you hold the line even under pressure&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Are exceptional at stakeholder management, particularly with senior sales and business development leaders who have strong opinions and high expectations&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Have experience designing and refining interview processes that are both predictive and efficient&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Can navigate global complexity, building frameworks that create consistency across regions while respecting local context and partnerships with regional leaders&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Actively use AI tools like Claude to drive your own productivity and enable your team to do the same&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong candidates may also have&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Experience partnering with Compensation on market analysis, leveling frameworks, and offer strategy for GTM roles&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Familiarity with recruiting for AI/ML or technical product companies where the business model and product are evolving rapidly&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Background in Partnerships or Business Development recruiting, not just Sales&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A track record of building recruiting forecasting models tied to revenue outcomes and pipeline predictability&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The annual compensation range for this role is listed below.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (&quot;OTE&quot;) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Annual Salary:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-range&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$295,000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;divider&quot;&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;$360,000 USD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logistics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education requirements: &lt;/strong&gt;We require at least a Bachelor&#39;s degree in a related field or equivalent experience.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Location-based hybrid policy:&lt;/strong&gt; Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time.
