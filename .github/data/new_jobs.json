In this role, you will help design and build AI-driven automations, bots, and internal applications that streamline how Voyager runs—from finance and HR to supply chain, manufacturing, and business development. You will work closely with the Internal AI Tools Lead and business stakeholders to understand real-world pain points, then turn them into concrete, working systems. You will build integrations, write services, wire up LLMs and agents, and ship tools that remove repetitive work from the organization and make our teams faster, more accurate, and more focused on high-value tasks. This role is ideal for early-career engineers (including exceptional new graduates) who love building things, are comfortable talking to users, and are excited to use AI as a core part of their engineering toolkit. You will be joining the Internal AI Tools Team, a small, high-leverage engineering group focused on building AI-powered systems that run Voyager itself. This team designs and delivers internal platforms, automations, and copilots that turn slow, manual workflows into streamlined, integrated systems.We work across the entire business—Finance & Accounting, Internal Communications, Performance Management, Human Resources, IT & Infrastructure, Cyber Security & Systems Assurance, Mergers & Acquisitions, R&D and Technology Roadmapping, Strategic Planning, Enterprise Risk Management, Quality Assurance, Supply Chain & Procurement, Manufacturing & Assembly, and Sales / New Business Capture.Our goal is simple: multiply the effectiveness of every team at Voyager by replacing spreadsheet-driven, email-based processes with secure, AI-driven workflows, decision-support tools, and intelligent assistants that dramatically reduce cycle times and improve execution quality. Responsibilities: Build and maintain AI-powered automations and workflows that streamline recurring business processes (e.g., report generation, approval flows, policy Q&A, data reconciliation). Implement internal tools and microservices that integrate with systems across Finance & Accounting, HR, IT, Cyber Security, Supply Chain, Manufacturing, and Sales / New Business Capture. Develop and maintain Slack/Teams bots, web frontends, and small internal apps that serve as “copilots” for business users. Use LLMs and agent frameworks to design task-specific assistants—such as a contract summarization agent, a supplier risk analysis agent, or an internal policy advisor bot. Work with the Internal AI Tools Lead and business stakeholders to map manual workflows into clear technical requirements and automation designs. Leverage agentic to rapidly write clean, tested code and contribute to shared libraries, templates, and best practices for internal automations. Monitor and debug automations in production; improve reliability and performance based on real-world usage and feedback. Required Qualifications: 0–3 years of professional software engineering experience (internships, research, or substantial personal projects all count; exceptional new graduates are encouraged to apply). Proficiency in at least one general-purpose programming language such as Python, TypeScript/JavaScript, or similar. Experience building scripts, APIs, small web apps, or workflow automations—whether in a professional setting, research lab, or serious side projects. Familiarity with RESTful APIs, webhooks, and basic data modeling using SQL or modern data stores. Hands-on experience using LLMs or automation platforms (e.g., OpenAI tools, LangChain, Zapier, n8n, or similar) to automate or accelerate real tasks. Strong ownership mindset and willingness to talk directly with non-technical users to understand problems and ship solutions quickly. Preferred Qualifications: Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Software Engineering, or a related STEM field; or equivalent experience. Experience with one or more of: internal tools development, low-code/no-code automation, or back-office systems (ERP, CRM, HRIS, ticketing, finance tools). Exposure to enterprise or security-conscious environments (e.g., defense, aerospace, healthcare, finance) where data protection and auditability are important. Portfolio or examples of personal projects—automations, bots, dashboards, or tools you built to make your own life or your team’s work easier. Interest in business operations and process improvement, not just writing code in isolation. Passion for writing and shipping code rapidly that has a measurable impact on business efficiency. Voyager offers a comprehensive, total compensation package, which includes competitive salary, a discretionary annual bonus plan, paid time off (PTO), a comprehensive health benefit package, retirement savings, wellness program, and various other benefits.
