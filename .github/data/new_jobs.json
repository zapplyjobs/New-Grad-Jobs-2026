We tackle the most complex challenges to unlock new frontiers for human progress, fortify national security, and protect critical assets to lead in the race for technological and operational superiority from ground to space. Forge the Future: Join Voyager Technologies The future belongs to those who build it. At Voyager Technologies, we’re building technologies that protect lives, expand frontiers and prepare us for what’s next. And we’re doing that with people who are wired to solve, build, adapt and lead. These roles are not for the faint of heart. You’ll help lay the foundation for humanity's future. Join a culture where innovation thrives, curiosity is rewarded, and impact is real. We’re a company of doers, thinkers and builders, united by purpose and grounded in reality. If you want to put your skills to work where the stakes are real and the mission is bigger than any one person, forge the future with Voyager. ____________________________________________________________________________________ Job Summary: We are seeking a Software Engineer – Manufacturing Integration (ACE) to connect the Agentic Computational Engineering platform to factories and machine shops. In this role, you will build the software that translates AI-generated designs into executable manufacturing instructions and closes the loop between the digital and physical worlds. You will also develop the infrastructure required to encode manufacturing constraints directly into the engineering process before any design has started. You will work at the intersection of CAM, factory systems, and AI, ensuring that when an agent says “design complete,” the shop floor can say “job started.” This role is ideal for someone who cares deeply about real hardware getting built and who is excited to seamlessly bridge AI design with hardware manufacturing. You will be joining the Agentic Computational Engineering (ACE) team, a specialized group within our Advanced Technology Development organization. ACE is responsible for building Voyager’s Generative Engine – the AI-native platform that compresses complex hardware development cycles from years to days. We design agentic AI systems that pair deeply with physics simulation, test data, and modern manufacturing so that Design for Manufacturing (DfM), Design for Assembly (DfA), and Design for Test (DfT) are built into the very first line of code and the very first sketch of a design. Responsibilities: Develop integrations between CAD/CAM systems and shop-floor equipment (CNC machines, printers, inspection tools) to automate manufacturing workflows. Work with partner manufacturers to develop the framework that allows our agentic system to design with their manufacturing constraints already baked in. Build services and scripts that generate toolpaths, feeds, speeds, and process plans from 3D models and process constraints. Implement virtual commissioning and digital twin simulations to validate manufacturing plans and detect collisions or infeasible operations. Integrate factory systems (MES, ERP, inventory) with the ACE platform so design decisions are aware of material availability and capacity. Capture and route manufacturing quality data (CMM measurements, photos, in-process sensors) back into the design and learning loops. Collaborate with manufacturing, quality, and AI teams to define robust, traceable interfaces between design and production. Use LLMs or scripting to automate repetitive integration and data-munging tasks around the factory stack. Required Qualifications: Clearance Required: Ability to obtain and maintain a U.S. Top Secret Security Clearance 0–5 years of experience in industrial automation, robotics, manufacturing software, or related domains (new graduates with strong hands-on projects encouraged to apply). Programming skills in Python and/or C++, with experience integrating with machine controllers, PLCs, or industrial protocols (e.g., OPC-UA, MTConnect) from internships or projects. Familiarity with CAM workflows and G-code, and understanding of CNC machining or additive manufacturing processes (coursework, maker spaces, or shop experience). Exposure to MES/ERP or factory-floor software systems, or strong interest in learning this stack rapidly. Demonstrated use of AI or scripting to automate repetitive engineering or manufacturing tasks. Preferred Qualifications: Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical, Electrical, Industrial Engineering, Computer Science, or a related field. Hands-on experience operating mills, lathes, 3D printers, or other machine tools. Experience building digital twins or simulation environments for manufacturing systems. Evidence of personal projects involving fabrication, robotics, or shop automation. Strong candidates should provide links to outstanding work (or descriptions when not possible to link) and have a strong software and engineering+manufacturing background paired with a passion for leveraging agentic teams for rapid development. Voyager offers a comprehensive, total compensation package, which includes competitive salary, a discretionary annual bonus plan, paid time off (PTO), a comprehensive health benefit package, retirement savings, wellness program, and various other benefits. When you join our team, you’re not just an employee; you become part of a dynamic community dedicated to innovation and excellence. To conform to U.S. Government space technology export regulations, including the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) you must be a U.S. citizen, lawful permanent resident of the U.S., protected individual as defined by 8 U.S.C. 1324b(a)(3), or eligible to obtain the required authorizations from the U.S. Department of State.

In this role, you will design, implement, and maintain AI agents that behave like focused junior engineers – thermal analysts, supply-chain scouts, G-code validators, and more. You will sit at the intersection of prompt engineering, tool integration, and evaluation. This role is a fit for someone who already uses LLMs daily, who gets impatient when they can’t automate a task, and who wants to see their agents move real hardware in the loop, not just push text around. You will be joining the Agentic Computational Engineering (ACE) team, a specialized group within our Advanced Technology Development organization.

Responsibilities: Design, implement, and deploy production-ready AI agents using frameworks such as LangGraph or Agent Development Kits from Google, OpenAI, or Anthropic. Define clear agent roles, goals, and capabilities, including prompts, tool schemas, and decision-making loops (e.g., ReAct, plan-and-solve). Develop and maintain Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that expose Voyager’s internal systems (PLM, ERP, simulation, repositories) to agents. Integrate external and internal engineering tools (e.g., Ansys, Altium, SolidWorks, Python toolchains) as robust, secure agent tools. Build evaluation suites and benchmarks that measure agent performance on realistic tasks (e.g., exam-style physics problems, PCB routing, CAD edits). Collaborate closely with domain experts to encode manufacturing, test, and safety constraints directly into agent behavior. Use LLMs as a development accelerator for scaffolding code, writing tests, and generating documentation for agent systems. Required Qualifications: 1–5 years of professional software engineering experience (exceptional new graduates and early-career engineers encouraged to apply). Strong proficiency in Python and experience building backend services and APIs or ability to rapidly learn (REST/gRPC). Hands-on experience building LLM-powered agents or tools using frameworks such as LangChain/LangGraph or similar (professional, research, or serious personal projects). Demonstrated habit of using LLMs and agents to accelerate development rather than writing all boilerplate by hand. Experience designing and documenting clean, versioned APIs and data schemas. Preferred Qualifications: Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Engineering, Physics, Mathematics, or a related field; or equivalent experience. Ability to read and reason about schematics, mechanical drawings, and technical documentation. Portfolio of personal projects involving robotics, 3D printing, electronics, or other physical-world builds. Experience building internal tooling for engineering, R&D, or manufacturing organizations.
