At Railway, we take the complexity out of shipping software. We aim to make developers more effective by allowing them to ship their code without any fuss — write your code, push it to us, and we deliver it to your end-users. We’re the Railway that takes your code from A to Z in a straight line: no transfers, no mad scrambling for boarding, no chaos in your journey. This is a hybrid user-facing role with some full-stack engineering elements. Learn more in our blog post at Support Engineering is Engineering . The sister role for this is Senior Software Engineer, Support . Want to learn about our work culture? Here is a four-part blog series that will help you see the unique ways our team works (Parts 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 ). About the role Be the voice of the customer, aggregating their passionate concerns into actionable product outcomes. Translate customer reports into actionable insights, surface patterns from individual issues, and ensure critical problems reach the right team with proper context. Create written content for internal and external audiences by writing documentation, runbooks, and customer communications that make infrastructure feel approachable. Understand the technical landscape our users are coming from and the relief they feel when Railway just works. About you Native proficiency in English language. Effective writing and communication skills with a personable nature; able to distill difficult technical concepts to a wide range of users An understanding that behind every deployment failure is a customer’s stress level spiking, and you can navigate both the technical debugging and the human reassurance needed to make things right An understanding of containers, deployment pipelines, databases, and cloud services well enough to quickly diagnose issues and guide users to solutions. Deployed apps, wrestled with databases, and debugged mysterious failures. You know enough to speak the same language as our users and diagnose where things went sideways. A mindset for pattern recognition. See three similar tickets and immediately start connecting dots. Is this a UI confusion? A missing feature? A bug that only happens on Tuesdays? You're constantly surfacing insights that help us fix problems at their root. The ability to remain the calm expert who makes problems feel solvable; you can context-switch between five different crisis modes while keeping each customer feeling like they're your only priority. This role, in our opinion, is perfect for folks who have done tours in Technical Support, Developer Advocacy, or Engineering roles where you worked closely with users. We don’t require you to check every box on the list, and we generally prefer working with people that are hungry for knowledge in areas they feel they’re lacking in. Please don’t hesitate to shoot us an application if you find Railway and the role interesting! We value and love to work with diverse persons from all backgrounds Things to know For better or worse, we're a startup; our team dynamics are different from companies of different sizes and stages. We're distributed ALL across the globe, and that's only going to be more and more distributed. As a result, stuff is ALWAYS happening. We do NOT expect you to work all the time, but you'll have to be diligent about your boundaries because the end of your day may overlap with the start of someone else's. We're a small team, with high ownership, who are not only passionate about what we do, but seek to be exceptional as well. At the time of writing we're 21, serving hundreds of thousands of users. There's a lot of stuff going on, and a lot of ambiguity. We want you to own it. We believe that ownership is a key to growth, and part of that growth is not only being able to make the choices, but owning the success, or failure, that comes with those choices. Benefits and perks At Railway, we provide best in class benefits. Great salary, full health benefits including dependents, strong equity grants, equipment stipend, and much more. For more details, check back on the main careers page . Beyond compensation, there are a few things that we believe that make working at Railway truly unique: Autonomy : We have very few meetings. Just a Monday and a Friday to go over the Company Board. We think your time is sacred, whether it's at work, or outside of work. Ownership : We're a company with a high ownership, high autonomy culture. We hope that you'll come in, help us, and over the course of many years do the best work of your life. When we bring you onboard, we expect you to change the company. Novel problems/solutions : We're a startup that's well funded, with cool problems, which lets us implement novel solutions! We abhor “busywork” and think, whether it's community, engineering, operations, etc there's always opportunity for creative and high leverage solutions. Growth : We want you to grow with us, but we know that talent is loaned, so when you figure out what area you want to grow in next, whether it's at Railway or outside, we'll make sure you land there. How we hire No tricks. No surprises.
