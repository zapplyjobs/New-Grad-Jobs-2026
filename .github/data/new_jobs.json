    "job_description": "About Vercel: Vercel gives developers the tools and cloud infrastructure to build, scale, and secure a faster, more personalized web. As the team behind v0, Next.js, and AI SDK, Vercel helps customers like Ramp, Supreme, PayPal, and Under Armour build for the AI-native web. Our mission is to enable the world to ship the best products. That starts with creating a place where everyone can do their best work. Whether you're building on our platform, supporting our customers, or shaping our story: You can just ship things.About the Role: We’re looking for an FP&A Manager, GTM to join our Finance team. You’ll be the financial lead for our go-to-market organizations, managing OpEx, headcount, and commissions forecasting while building systems and workflows that scale. You’ll partner cross-functionally with RevOps, Strategic Finance, and Talent to ensure investment decisions are aligned with business goals and budget targets and backed by precision. If you’re based within a pre-determined commuting distance of one of our offices (SF, NY, London, or Berlin), the role includes in-office anchor days on Monday, Tuesday, and Friday. If you're located beyond that distance, the role is fully remote. For location-specific details, please connect with our recruiting team. What You Will Do: Own the GTM budget envelope – Manage OpEx and headcount budgets for our largest teams. Ensure initiatives are fully funded and stay within burn targets, partnering with StratFin on growth, ROI, and unit economics. Drive dollar-based headcount planning – Shift planning from “headcount adds” to a detailed bottoms up approach, aligning with org structures. Collaborate with RevOps, Talent, and StratFin to balance sales and marketing resources with financial constraints. Reinvent the Monthly Business Review – Own GTM budget vs. actuals (BvA) meetings. Automate variance reporting to remove admin work and focus the conversation on decision-making. Forecast with precision – Lead forecasting for sales and marketing, inclusive of vendor and headcount spend, partnering with Accounting to eliminate blind spots in our outlook. Design frictionless controls – Design approval workflows (for headcount backfills, vendor spend, T&E) that are rigorous but fast. You will use technology to approve the routine and flag the exceptions, avoiding \"bottleneck bureaucracy.\" System Implementation – Drive GTM system implementations from a finance perspective, aligning planning, reporting, and forecasting workflows to support scale, automation, and consistent measurement of performance. About You: Anti-bureaucracy, pro-speed – You streamline workflows, remove drag, and make decisions with clarity. You believe a 3-bullet Slack post with a clear recommendation is better than a 20-slide deck. Tech-forward operator – You go beyond Excel. You use AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot) to automate, clean, and generate insights. You treat Finance like a product—always shipping improvements. Detail-obsessed – You know that a single error in commission logic or start dates can swing the forecast by millions. You sweat the details so the CFO doesn’t have to. Benefits: Competitive compensation package, including equity. Inclusive Healthcare Package. Learn and Grow - we provide mentorship and send you to events that help you build your network and skills. Flexible Time Off. We will provide you the gear you need to do your role, and a WFH budget for you to outfit your space as needed. The San Francisco, CA base pay range for this role is $160,000 - $210,000. Actual salary will be based on job-related skills, experience, and location. Compensation outside of San Francisco may be adjusted based on employee location. The total compensation package may include benefits, equity-based compensation, and eligibility for a company bonus or variable pay program depending on the role. Your recruiter can share more details during the hiring process. Vercel is committed to fostering and empowering an inclusive community within our organization. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, gender expression or identity, sexual orientation, national origin, citizenship, age, marital status, veteran status, disability status, or any other characteristic protected by law. Vercel encourages everyone to apply for our available positions, even if they don't necessarily check every box on the job description.",

How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

    "job_description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the Team The Universes team within Research is responsible for training AI models to perform complex, difficult, long-horizon agentic tasks in ultra-realistic settings. We design and implement novel training environments that go far beyond what models can do today — environments where models learn to navigate ambiguity, handle interruptions, maintain context over extended interactions, and exercise judgment in open-ended scenarios. About the Role We're looking for Research Engineers to help us build the next generation of training environments for capable and safe agentic AI. This role blends research and engineering responsibilities, requiring you to both implement novel approaches and contribute to research direction. You'll work on fundamental research in reinforcement learning, designing training environments and methodologies that push the state of the art, and building evaluations that measure genuine capability. Responsibilities: Build the next generation of agentic environments Build rigorous evaluations that measure real capability Collaborate across research and infrastructure teams to ship environments into production training Debug and iterate rapidly across research and production ML stacks Contribute to research culture through technical discussions and collaborative problem-solving You may be a good fit if you: Are highly impact-driven — you care about outcomes, not activity Operate with high agency Have good research taste or senior technical experience, demonstrating good judgment in identifying what actually matters in complex problem spaces Can balance research exploration with engineering implementation Are passionate about the potential impact of AI and are committed to developing safe and beneficial systems Are comfortable with uncertainty and adapt quickly as the landscape shifts Have strong software engineering skills and can build robust infrastructure Enjoy pair programming (we love to pair!) Strong candidates may also have one or more of the following: Have industry experience with large language model training, fine-tuning or evaluation Have industry experience building RL environments, simulation systems, or large-scale ML infrastructure Senior experience in a relevant technical field even if transitioning domains Deep expertise in sandboxing, containerization, VM infrastructure, or distributed systems Published influential work in relevant ML areas The annual compensation range for this role is below. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. Our total compensation package for full-time employees includes equity and benefits.Annual Salary:$500,000 - $800,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.
