If it’s in your project, we probably use it in ours too. We believe deeply in the open-source ecosystem and strive to support—not replace—existing tools and communities.\n\n\nHIRING PROCESS\n\nWe keep things simple, async-friendly, and respectful of your time:\n\n 1. Apply – Our team will review your application.\n\n 2. Intro Call – A short video chat to get to know each other.\n\n 3. Interviews – Up to four calls with:\n    \n    - Founders\n    \n    - Future teammates\n    \n    - Someone cross-functional from product, growth, or engineering (depending on the role)\n\n 4. Decision – We may follow up with a final question or go straight to offer.\n\nAll communication is remote and we aim to move fast.",
