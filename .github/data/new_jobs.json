    "job_description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the role: As a Support Operations Specialist focused on Anthropic’s Enterprise customers, you will be instrumental in pioneering an AI-native support model that serves our largest customers. This role blends program management, system design, and operational excellence to transform how we deliver Enterprise support at scale. You'll own the strategic roadmap for Enterprise support operations, working at the intersection of AI capabilities, customer experience, and operational infrastructure. This means designing conversation flows that leverage AI capabilities, analyzing support data to identify automation opportunities, and managing cross-functional projects that scale our Enterprise support function. Responsibilities: Own quarterly roadmaps for enhancing AI support effectiveness with Enterprise use cases, prioritizing initiatives based on customer impact and data insights Design and implement conversation flows that provide personalized support by leveraging integrations, Model Context Protocol (MCP) connections, and external data sources Build intelligent triage logic and escalation rules that balance AI efficiency with human touch for complex cases Analyze CSAT, resolution rates, and escalation patterns to identify opportunities for automation and improvement Scope, design, and implement processes, tools, and systems specifically for Enterprise customer needs Create monitoring dashboards and reporting mechanisms to track AI performance, and translate insights from customer interactions into actionable improvements Partner with Product, Engineering, and GTM teams to integrate Enterprise feature launches into support workflows You might be a good fit if you: Have 5+ years of experience in support operations, customer success operations, or similar roles (Enterprise/B2B customer exposure strongly preferred) Possess strong program and project management skills with a track record of delivering complex, cross-functional initiatives Have hands-on experience with ticketing systems (ideally Intercom), help centers, and support automation tools Are genuinely excited about AI and see the potential for it to enhance (not replace) human expertise in customer support Have deep empathy for customer pain points and consistently prioritize user experience in operational decisions Combine analytical rigor with creative problem-solving—you're equally comfortable analyzing CSAT data and designing conversational flows Think in systems: you naturally see how processes, tools, and people interconnect and can design solutions holistically Build strong cross-functional partnerships and can influence outcomes across Engineering, Product, and Go-to-Market teams Thrive in ambiguous environments and can create structure and process where none exists Have excellent written communication skills and can translate complex technical concepts into clear documentation Are adaptable and energized by learning quickly in a fast-moving environment The expected base compensation for this position is below. Our total compensation package for full-time employees includes equity, benefits, and may include incentive compensation.Annual Salary:$131,040 - $165,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

    "job_description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems. About the Role As a Technical Program Manager for Security, you'll drive execution of high-stakes programs that span security engineering, infrastructure, and cross-functional teams across Anthropic. You'll be responsible for the strategy, planning, and execution of technical security programs that enable Anthropic to meet its Responsible Scaling Policy (RSP) commitments while building towards a security posture that scales with our rapid growth. This role sits at the intersection of Security Engineering, Security Compliance, Infrastructure, Product, Research, Policy, and more. This role demands someone who thrives in ambiguity, makes well-reasoned decisions under pressure, and can translate complex security requirements into executable programs with compressed timelines. Responsibilities: Own end-to-end security program execution for RSP security readiness– Drive security workstreams from requirements interpretation through implementation, coordinating across Security Engineering, Infrastructure, Research, and Compliance teams to ensure we meet RSP commitments on aggressive timelines Lead infrastructure security programs – Manage programs like cluster hardening, service boundary enforcement, and security observability that protect our most sensitive assets including model weights and training infrastructure Coordinate complex multi-team deployments – Manage security control rollouts and migrations, like endpoint hardening and egress reduction that require careful change management across engineering organizations Make real-time technical trade-off decisions – Balance competing constraints between security controls, research velocity, and operational feasibility during fast-moving program cycles Build program structure for emerging security domains – Create program charters, establish roles and timelines, develop communication strategies, and define success metrics for nascent security initiatives Partner with third-party partners – Manage security aspects of infrastructure partnerships, including contract requirements, relationship management, and security assurance processes Lead stakeholder communication and executive reporting – Prepare regular status updates, deliver company-wide communications, lead program reviews, and ensure leadership has visibility into critical security milestones, blockers, and risks You may be a good fit if you: Have experience driving cross-functional projects, building longer-running programs, and interfacing with technical and non-technical stakeholders. Have experience executing technical programs that require systems and engineering-level knowledge. Have a deep interest in and/or a willingness to learn about cybersecurity or regulatory compliance. Have experience leveraging LLMs to automate workflows, improve operational efficiency, and develop novel solutions for complex technical and organizational challenges. Have experience reporting on complex programs through data-driven benchmarks, including writing SQL queries. Have strong interpersonal skills that enable you to influence without authority, build cross-organizational support, cooperation and action around security initiatives, policies and procedures. Have a track record for being able to successfully organize, implement and manage complex programs and projects. Are used to working through trade-offs, balancing competing priorities, and having your mind changed. Deadline to apply: None, applications will be received on a rolling basis. The expected base compensation for this position is below. Our total compensation package for full-time employees includes equity, benefits, and may include incentive compensation.Annual Salary:$290,000 - $365,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.
