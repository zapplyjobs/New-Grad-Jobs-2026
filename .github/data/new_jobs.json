It’s like discovering your favorite TV show mid-season, except you're helping write the next episode. It’s like unboxing a new gadget, except you’re the one designing it. You shape how it feels, how it works, and how people react when they use it. At Solidroad we're solving a big, messy, exciting problem: how do you scale customer support without losing what makes humans amazing? Warmth, empathy, intuition. We’re using AI, generative tech, and real-time simulations to make this happen. It's ambitious, difficult, and genuinely new. About the role We're looking for someone early in their career who sees this role as signing up for a job and a hobby. Or signing up for a job and a triathlon. Or a job and a language course. It’ll challenge you, stretch you, and fill your life in the best way possible. You’ll write code (full-stack, frontend, backend, it's all on the table), learn more in a month than you might in a year elsewhere, and probably ship something important faster than you expect. Sometimes it'll be uncomfortable, but you'll also have moments of genuine \"wow, we built that\" pride. What you'll actually do day-to-day Build Advanced Prompt Engineering and Retrieval Pipelines Help us handle thousands of customer conversations daily, across integrations like Zendesk, Intercom, and Salesforce. You’ll build cutting-edge generation pipelines to deliver instant insights and accurate scoring of interactions. Create Real-Time Multimodal Simulations Build engaging, realistic training experiences across voice, video, and chat using tools like OpenAI, ElevenLabs, and Vapi. These interactive scenarios dynamically adapt to user input, making training feel authentic and effective. Craft High-Performance User Experiences Use Next.js to build intuitive, lightning-fast UIs capable of handling complex AI interactions smoothly. You’ll create polished interfaces that run seamlessly, even when things get technically challenging. Our Team &amp; Culture We’re a small, focused group working full-time in our San Francisco office. We’re here five days a week because building something ambitious means collaborating closely, solving problems together, sharing ideas spontaneously, and occasionally challenging each other to padel matches, cold plunges, or karaoke evenings. We're intentional about creating a culture that's mature, supportive, and fun. You'll be joining experienced founders who've done this before, alongside a tight-knit team genuinely excited about building something impactful. We hope you Spent a bit of time at a startup (Series A to C ideally), so you know the thrill and the chaos that comes with early-stage building. Have solid computer science foundations, whether through formal education or teaching yourself obsessively. Built something cool that made you proud. Maybe it's popular on GitHub, maybe it’s an app your friends actually use, or maybe it's still half-broken but you're excited to finish it. Whatever it is, we’d love to see it. The good, the bad, and the honest truth The highs here are incredibly high, direct mentorship from founders who’ve done this before, lots of autonomy, and a product you'll feel proud of. The lows are that you'll need to move fast, make decisions with incomplete info, and sometimes work through messy problems alone. But the reality is that startups are a bit like a sport or an instrument: you invest in it not just because you have to, but because you genuinely want to be better tomorrow than you are today. If that sounds exciting, don’t second-guess yourself. Get in touch. Send us something you’re proud of (GitHub, personal site, anything goes) and a short note about who you are and why this feels right to you. Enthusiasm and drive count more here than a long CV.",
