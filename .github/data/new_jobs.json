Large-scale language models are evolving from clever chatbots into powerful engines of linguistic and cultural understanding. With high-quality training data, tomorrow’s AI can democratize education, accelerate research, and support global communication across languages and contexts. That training data begins with you—we need your expertise to help power the next generation of AI. We’re looking for Japanese speakers who understand the nuances of grammar, usage, spelling, tone, and cultural context in both formal and informal Japanese. You’ll challenge advanced AI models with linguistic edge cases, cultural subtleties, translation ambiguities, and phrasing differences—documenting model failures and guiding improvements with clarity and precision. On a typical day, you will engage in text-based conversations with the model, evaluate its responses for accuracy and fluency, annotate linguistic patterns, test comprehension across a range of Japanese language inputs, and suggest refinements to prompts and evaluation methods. A background in linguistics, translation, writing, localization, or teaching is ideal. Experience with Japanese language instruction, editing, or QA is a strong signal of fit. Clear communication and a reflective approach to language—explaining not just what is correct, but why—is essential. Ready to turn your Japanese fluency into the foundation for tomorrow’s AI? Apply today and help train the model that will teach the world. We offer a pay range of $8 to $65 per hour, with the exact rate determined after evaluating your experience, expertise, and geographic location.
