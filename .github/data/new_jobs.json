    "job_description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.Anthropic’s Audio team pushes the boundaries of what's possible with audio with large language models. We care about making safe, steerable, reliable systems that can understand and generate speech and audio, prioritizing not only naturalness but also steerability and robustness. As a researcher on the Audio team, you'll work across the full stack of audio ML, developing audio codecs and representations, sourcing and synthesizing high quality audio data, training large-scale speech language models and large audio diffusion models, and developing novel architectures for incorporating continuous signals into LLMs. Our team focuses primarily but not exclusively on speech, building advanced steerable systems spanning end-to-end conversational systems, speech and audio understanding models, and speech synthesis capabilities. The team works closely with many collaborators across pretraining, finetuning, reinforcement learning, production inference, and product to get advanced audio technologies from early research to high impact real-world deployments. You may be a good fit if you: Have hands-on experience with training audio models, whether that's conversational speech-to-speech, speech translation, speech recognition, text-to-speech, diarization, codecs, or generative audio models Genuinely enjoy both research and engineering work, and you'd describe your ideal split as roughly 50/50 rather than heavily weighted toward one or the other Are comfortable working across abstraction levels, from signal processing fundamentals to large-scale model training and inference optimization Have deep expertise with JAX, PyTorch, or large-scale distributed training, and can debug performance issues across the full stack Thrive in fast-moving environments where the most important problem might shift as we learn more about what works Communicate clearly and collaborate effectively; audio touches many parts of our systems, so you'll work closely with teams across the company Are passionate about building conversational AI that feels natural, steerable, and safe Care about the societal impacts of voice AI and want to help shape how these systems are developed responsibly Strong candidates may also have experience with: Large language model pretraining and finetuning Training diffusion models for image and audio generation Reinforcement learning for large language models and diffusion models End-to-end system optimization, from performance benchmarking to kernel optimization GPUs, Kubernetes, PyTorch, or distributed training infrastructure Representative projects: Training state-of-the art neural audio codecs for 48 kHz stereo audio Developing novel algorithms for diffusion pretraining and reinforcement learning Scaling audio datasets to millions of hours of high quality audio Creating robust evaluation methodologies for hard-to-measure qualities such as naturalness or expressiveness Studying training dynamics of mixed audio-text language models Optimizing latency and inference throughput for deployed streaming audio systems The annual compensation range for this role is listed below. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.Annual Salary:$350,000 - $500,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the role: Anthropic is pioneering safe and reliable AI assistants. As we continue to advance industry-leading language models, the Claude Developer Platform (CDP) — including our APIs, SDKs, and developer tooling — is how tens of thousands of developers build AI-powered applications. We're seeking a technical documentation specialist with strong technical fluency and AI development experience to lead comprehensive documentation efforts and drive adoption across the global developer community. This role goes beyond traditional technical writing. You'll own the documentation content experience for the Claude Developer Platform — APIs, SDKs, integration patterns, and AI application development workflows. You'll create the standards and resources that shape how developers worldwide build with Claude, from their first API call to production-scale AI pipelines. You'll work at the intersection of developer tooling, AI application development, and developer education. Technical requirements: This role requires solid code literacy — you should be able to read and understand API references, SDK code, and developer examples well enough to write accurate documentation about them. You'll work closely with engineering and devrel teams who build reference implementations and cookbooks, but you need enough technical fluency to independently write clear code snippets, test examples, and understand the developer experience you're documenting. Familiarity with AI development patterns (prompt engineering, tool use, multi-step workflows) is important so you can explain them credibly. Responsibilities: Develop authoritative best practices documentation for building AI applications with Claude, including prompt engineering, tool use, streaming, multi-turn workflows, and agentic patterns Create extensive resources for different development environments, languages, and frameworks, including working code examples Design and document developer onboarding experiences, from first API call to production deployment Build comprehensive guides for common AI development patterns and concepts: context engineering, evaluation workflows, content generation systems, classification tasks, and multi-step agents Develop multimedia technical content including architecture diagrams, concept visualizations, and integration pattern illustrations Collaborate with engineering teams to document new platform features, SDK releases, and capability expansions Establish metrics and feedback loops to measure documentation effectiveness and identify developer friction points Partner with developer relations teams to create content for conferences, blog posts, and community engagement Contribute to documentation toolchain and infrastructure improvements You may be a good fit if you have: 5+ years of experience in technical writing and developer education, with demonstrated expertise in API and SDK documentation Hands-on experience building AI applications using Claude or other LLMs — you've developed real projects, not just written about them Proficiency in Python and TypeScript/JavaScript sufficient to write, debug, and publish clean example code Strong understanding of AI development patterns: context engineering, evaluation, tool use, and agentic workflows Experience creating developer-facing content (written and visual) that drives understanding and reduces friction Deep understanding of modern software development practices including version control, CI/CD, testing, and API design Strong understanding of web architectures, authentication patterns, and integration approaches Excellent technical communication skills with ability to explain complex AI concepts to developers at varying skill levels Experience conducting developer research and gathering feedback to inform documentation strategy Demonstrated ability to create comprehensive workflow documentation and developer guides Strong candidates may also have: Published content (blog posts, videos, tutorials) demonstrating AI development best practices Experience with developer tooling, SDK design, or API platform teams Background in AI/ML application development and prompt engineering Contributions to open-source projects related to AI development Background in software engineering with experience shipping developer-facing products Knowledge of evaluation frameworks, observability tools, and production AI system monitoring Visual design sensibility — ability to create clear architecture diagrams, technical slides, and concept visualizations The annual compensation range for this role is listed below.

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the Role: Anthropic is seeking an Education Platform Engineering Lead to help build the technical foundation for how Anthropic educates customers and enterprises at scale, and to shape what that even means when AI is the delivery mechanism, not just the subject being taught. Your work will define how millions of people experience learning about Claude: how content is served and adapted in real time, how assessments respond to what a learner actually understands, how credentialing systems verify genuine competence rather than course completion, and how the entire platform evolves as fast as the product it teaches. You'll build the infrastructure that makes AI-native education real — not as a concept, but as a working system that people interact with every day. You’ll own the technical vision for our AI-driven educational experience: the platform layer, enterprise readiness features, the data architecture, the AI-augmented pipelines, the integrations, and the delivery systems. You'll work with a handful of highly technical educational collaborators to own the technical vision and execution for how Anthropic’s education team delivers educational experiences at scale, and you'll build the AI-augmented pipelines and platform capabilities that let a small team of educators operate with reach and responsiveness that would otherwise require an organization ten times larger. This is an engineering role for someone who genuinely cares about how people learn. You'll make platform decisions that are deeply educational, and you need the judgment to make those decisions well, not just implement someone else's spec. You'll interface closely with Anthropic's security, infrastructure, and data teams, and you'll partner with trainers and educators on the GTM, devrel, and education teams who will be your primary stakeholders. About Anthropic Anthropic is an AI safety and research company that's working to build reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our customers and for society as a whole. Our interdisciplinary team has experience across ML, physics, policy, business and product. Responsibilities: Architect and own Anthropic’s enterprise ready education platform and infrastructure — authentication/SSO, learner data models, content delivery, credentialing, and progress tracking — designed for scale, AI-forward features, and reliability from day one Own the technical vision for how Anthropic delivers AI-driven educational experiences and shaping what's possible, not just building what's requested. You’ll determine what to build, what to extend, and what to replace as needs evolve Build AI-augmented pipelines for content generation, real-time adaptation, assessment delivery, and quality assurance — working closely with the education team to understand what these systems need to do pedagogically Design platform capabilities that enable genuinely new kinds of empowering learning experiences — adaptive paths, competency-based progression, AI-evaluated demonstrations of skill — not just digital versions of traditional courses Interface with Anthropic's security, infrastructure, and data teams to ensure education systems meet organizational standards and integrate cleanly with existing architecture Build platform abstractions that let non-engineers on the team configure, extend, and experiment with educational experiences without engineering bottlenecks Make product-level decisions about how the platform works — you're shaping what the learning experience is, not just serving it You may be a good fit if you have: 7+ years of software engineering experience, with demonstrated ability to take a platform from zero to production at scale Genuine passion for education — you think about how people learn, you have opinions about what educational technology should look like in an AI-native world, and you want to build it A strong eye for quality educational content, with a sense of the complex systems that produce it Full-stack engineering skills with particular strength in backend systems: databases, APIs, authentication, reliability, and infrastructure Experience building and operating platforms that serve many concurrent users reliably Comfort with ambiguity and ownership: you'll need to translate pedagogical intent into technical architecture without heavy specification Experience interfacing with security and infrastructure teams to meet organizational requirements while maintaining development velocity A working practice of using AI tools in your own engineering workflows — and genuine curiosity about how AI fundamentally changes what educational platforms can be Strong candidates may also have: Experience building or significantly contributing to learning platforms, credentialing systems, or educational technology products Background in or exposure to learning science, instructional design, or educational research Experience with SSO/identity (SAML, OAuth), badging standards (Open Badges), or LTI integrations Familiarity with building systems that incorporate LLM capabilities as core infrastructure Prior work at a high-growth company where you built platform infrastructure that other teams depended on Experience designing systems that non-technical users configure and operate The annual compensation range for this role is listed below. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.Annual Salary:$300,000 - $405,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time.

    "job_description": "Figma is growing our team of passionate creatives and builders on a mission to make design accessible to all. Figma’s platform helps teams bring ideas to life—whether you're brainstorming, creating a prototype, translating designs into code, or iterating with AI. From idea to product, Figma empowers teams to streamline workflows, move faster, and work together in real time from anywhere in the world. If you're excited to shape the future of design and collaboration, join us! Figma is all-in on AI — not just as a feature, but as a foundational shift in how we build, scale, and serve our users. As our CEO and executive team have shared, AI is central to Figma’s long-term product strategy, and we're investing deeply across the stack: from model quality and infrastructure reliability to data pipelines and evaluation workflows. We’re hiring a seasoned Technical Program Manager (TPM) to help lead the platform side of that work — building scalable systems to support annotation, capacity planning, and model delivery. This is a technical, execution-heavy role for a seasoned TPM who would be excited to solve AI reliability, scale, and data quality in equal parts. You’ll partner closely with engineering, infra, design, AI research, and product teams to manage cross-org delivery of our most important AI Services — and help ensure our infra and evaluation loops scale to meet real product demand. If you’re comfortable working across quota tracking, labeling pipelines, cost modeling, and launch readiness — this role was made for you. This is a full time role that can be held from one of our US hubs or remotely in the United States. What you'll do at Figma: Own and drive programs supporting Figma’s AI research and platform — including annotation velocity, evaluation pipelines, and cost/capacity readiness Partner with Infra and Finance to plan model scaling across providers: track token usage, forecast traffic, manage regional limits, optimize caching strategies, and reduce latency Lead our internal AI Annotation Program: manage vendors and design annotators. Define task priorities, improve quality standards and increase annotator throughput Support internal AIOps initiatives — model go/no-go decision making, monitor model behavior, prevent regressions, and ensure readiness across quality gates Drive cross-functional execution of key AI-powered product features — coordinate scope, risks, comms, and launch checklists Partner with Data Science to maintain and improve internal visibility: annotation metrics, token quotas, reliability dashboards, and evaluation timelines We’d love to hear from you if you have: 4+ years of technical program management experience (or equivalent) in AI platform, AI research, and AI infrastructure Understand how AI gets built and scaled: model evaluation loops, annotation pipelines, quota limits, and data versioning Have hands-on experience running AI cost/capacity reviews, forecast planning, and vendor oversight. Deep understanding of model cost mechanics, including token burn, cache hit rates, latency, and quota limits Comfort operating in high-ambiguity, high-velocity environments with exec visibility Strong writing and communication skills — you bring structure, clarity, and momentum to complex technical programs Bring a systems-thinking mindset to the AI delivery pipeline, and know where to tighten loops or increase speed While it’s not required, it’s an added plus if you also have: Experience with AI vendor contracts, third-party API quotas, or multi-cloud capacity planning Background in AIOps / model quality pipelines — even better if you've built or scaled them Scaled contractor or external vendor teams delivering core data operations Strong bias to action, self-motivation and curiosity, with desire to bring people together and deliver high quality results in the constantly evolving growth and excitement of a start-up culture Familiarity with a modern scaled web stack (AWS, Sinatra, React) At Figma, one of our values is Grow as you go.
