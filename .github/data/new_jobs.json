    "job_description": "Intro to Folia Measure what matters. Nell and Dan founded Folia Health because it has been simply too hard for their family members to receive personalized, data-driven healthcare that directly addresses the issues they're dealing with. People around the country and now the world, including our own team members and families, use Folia to track what they're experiencing - fatigue, symptom flares, pain - alongside what they're currently doing for treatment, and then use this information to understand the best way forward. Most Folia users also receive Data Dividends to share their data as part of our Research Programs, the business model that keeps Folia humming along. Along the journey of building Folia, we've developed and validated a new type of health data - home-reported outcomes (or HROs). HROs allow people dealing with complex conditions to digitize their vast personal health knowledge, with simple responses to a personalized set of multiple-choice questions whenever they're experiencing a change in their health. HROs are actually now a valued part of the research methods that leading life sciences companies use to understand how their therapies are impacting people in the real world. Folia (‘foglia’ is leaf in Italian) was named for the power of the individual contributions of people tracking their own health experiences. Each individual contributor is a leaf on the tree, performing important tasks to enable the whole (healthcare) tree to grow and become stronger - ultimately benefitting the leaf itself. (Yes we may have taken the metaphor too far...) We are: Female-founded and led by parents and family caregivers Stubbornly focused on making healthcare make sense 9 years in business Backed by top venture funds with a strong financial runway Made possible by our fast-growing user community with thousands of users in rare conditions We are a small and highly collaborative engineering team supporting a large number of projects and initiatives.
