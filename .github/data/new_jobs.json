At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco.

One of the biggest challenges AI companies face today is data quality. The success of any AI application relies heavily on the quality of its training data, yet for most teams, this crucial step is both the most costly and time-consuming. We’re here to change that.As former computer scientists, physicists, and quants, we’ve experienced firsthand how a lack of tools to prepare quality training data impedes progress in building AI. We believe AI is at a stage similar to the early days of computing or the internet—where the potential is clear, but the surrounding tools and processes are still catching up. That's why we started Encord.We are a talented and ambitious team of 100+, working at the cutting edge of computer vision and deep learning. Backed by $30M in Series B funding from top investors like CRV and Y Combinator, we’re one of the fastest-growing companies in our space.

We’re looking for graduate full-stack engineers, whether you’re more front-end or back-end leaning, who are passionate about solving real customer problems and thrive in autonomous squads of 4–5 people.Encord is growing rapidly, with our product as the key driver of that growth. A year ago, we were a team of 50; now, we’re over 100 and continuing to accelerate. Joining us now means stepping in at a crucial stage of expansion for the company, product, and team. Your contributions here will have a real, visible impact.If you’re finishing university and looking for your first full-time engineering role where you can learn fast, build meaningful products, and grow alongside an exceptional team, Encord could be the perfect place for you.What to expectHigh performing team: You'll join the small team that has built a product that our customers love and consistently rate as the best in the market.
