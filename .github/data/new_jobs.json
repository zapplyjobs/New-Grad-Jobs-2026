However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the Role A systems-level engineer specializing in build infrastructure and low-level systems optimization, with expertise in maintaining and improving non-trivial C/C++ builds and other host level systems. This role requires deep technical knowledge of compilation processes, hardware-software interfaces, build systems, and the ability to debug and optimize at the system level. Responsibilities: Build Systems & Toolchains Expert-level proficiency with build/packaging systems (Nix, pip, uv, CMake, Bazel, Make, etc…) Nix experience in particular is a huge plus Experience managing complex builds and interacting in non-trivial ways with CI Skilled in diagnosing and resolving linking issues, symbol resolution problems, and toolchain/ABI incompatibilities Low-Level Systems/Embedded Programming Strong C/C++ debugging skills, especially nice if in embedded systems or in dealing with cross compiling/linking Comfortable with system calls, POSIX APIs, and kernel interfaces Experience with toolchain debugging tools like readelf, bloaty, c++filt, nm, etc… Compiler & Toolchain Experience Basic knowledge of compilers (understanding things like passes, having multiples levels of IR, what kinds of operations are done on it, etc…) Experience with cross-compilers (compiling code for target devices) Experience with detailed compiler flags optimization and custom toolchain configuration Understanding of linking processes, object file formats (ELF, DWARF), and ABI compatibility Strong candidates may have: Machine Learning Infrastructure Basic understanding of deep learning frameworks (PyTorch, Jax) from a systems perspective Understanding of tensor operations Experience with distributed training infrastructure is a plus You may be a good fit if you have: 5+ years of experience in systems programming or infrastructure roles Often comes from backgrounds in: HPC, game engine development, embedded systems, OS, or compiler teams Strong debugging mindset with patience for complex, multi-layered issues Self-directed problem solver who can navigate large, legacy codebases This profile would be ideal for roles in ML infrastructure teams, HPC environments, or any organization dealing with non-trivial C/C++ systems that need optimization at the build and runtime level. Deadline to apply: None. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis. The expected base compensation for this position is below. Our total compensation package for full-time employees includes equity, benefits, and may include incentive compensation.Annual Salary:$315,000 - $405,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

    "job_description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.At Anthropic, we believe new AI capabilities are best achieved through secure foundations, not in spite of them. As capabilities grow more advanced, it is critical that progress moves forward safely and for the benefit of all society. It is the reason why security sits at the center of our work, and not as an afterthought. We're specifically looking for a Software Engineer to help us build and maintain new agentic coding tools for developers. The ideal candidate will have a passion for developer tools, extensive knowledge of diverse programming environments and languages, and experience with advanced LLM features like tool-use, chaining and orchestration patterns, and prompt engineering. Curiosity about AI research is a must! Responsibilities: Design, build, and maintain scalable features and infrastructure for AI-powered development tools Engage directly with developers inside and outside Anthropic to gather insights and improve user experience Collaborate with researchers to improve model capabilities through shared tools and evals Stay ahead of advancements in AI-assisted coding by experimenting with new tools, evaluating emerging techniques, and tracking enhancements to existing ones Contribute across the stack—from front-end UI to back-end infrastructure—to develop new features, fix bugs, and optimize performance Dive into possibly unfamiliar areas like Python notebooks, VS Code plug-ins, and containerized environments. You may be a good fit if you: Are excited about AI-assisted coding as a tool to enhance developer productivity and creativity—not replace human ingenuity Spend a lot of time refining and customizing your AI workflows Have experience building and maintaining dev tools Are an expert in React development, including performance optimization, modern patterns (hooks, context, suspense), and component architecture Specialize in user experience engineering but are a capable full stack developer Have hands-on experience working with large language models and prompt engineering Have worked on projects with stringent safety, security and/or compliance requirements Care about the societal impacts and ethics of your work Strong candidates may also have experience with: Building and maintaining CLI tools Working in large codebases and quickly jumping in to unfamiliar development environments Working with container orchestration and cloud infrastructure Scaling TypeScript projects Working with alternate JavaScript runtimes like Bun and Deno The expected base compensation for this position is below. Our total compensation package for full-time employees includes equity, benefits, and may include incentive compensation.Annual Salary:$320,000 - $560,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the Role We're looking for desktop app engineers to join our Claude product team and help build native applications that harness the transformative power of advanced language models. Your mission will be to package our AI capabilities into elegant desktop experiences that put unprecedented capabilities at users' fingertips. You will work with a talented team of engineers, researchers, and product specialists to design and implement key components that bridge our AI technology with intuitive user interfaces. Join us in this exciting mission to transform how people engage with our AI technology and unlock new realms of human potential. Today, our app is mostly web-based – but we’re eager to build the best possible version of Claude for macOS and Windows with a mix of both native and web technologies. You might be a great fit for this role if you’re up for the challenge of learning multiple programming languages. We are more interested in strong engineers excited to learn new languages and technologies to build the best possible experience than we are looking for people with hands-on experience in Chromium, Electron, C++, or the various native macOS and Windows APIs. We believe that strong engineers can learn whatever technology is best suited to build the best possible experience – and we understand that even the best engineers will have little experience with one of the operating systems and areas we’d like to invest in. We’re looking for curious engineers excited to figure out, with us, what AI on the desktop could do. Responsibilities: Develop and maintain the core infrastructure and features within Claude.ai and in our Electron-based desktop app using a typical web stack (TypeScript, React) Use native code (Rust, Swift, C++) to bring advanced features to the desktop app, connecting Claude to macOS and Windows Optimize application performance, memory usage, and startup time across platforms Design and build robust update mechanisms and deployment pipelines Create monitoring tools to track application performance and user experience Build a strong intuition for how advanced LLMs could be most useful on your computer, augmenting humans in their work You may be a good fit if you have: Have 5+ years of experience as a software engineer, with strong emphasis on desktop application development Have practical experience with Electron and deep understanding of its architecture Possess strong JavaScript/TypeScript skills and experience with modern frontend frameworks Take a product-focused approach and care about building solutions that are robust, scalable, and easy to use Have experience with native module development in C++ to extend application capabilities Understand macOS and/or Windows platform-specific technologies and development patterns Have experience with cross-platform application packaging, code signing, and distribution Thrive in a fast-paced, collaborative environment and enjoy working closely with cross-functional teams We’re working with a large number of technologies - and you might be an excellent candidate even if you’ve only worked with a subset of them. An ideal candidate may have never used Electron before but does have hands-on experience in working with Chromium’s C++. Similarly, a great candidate may have worked on Electron apps, but hasn’t used C++ or Swift before. We understand that even the best engineers will have more experience with some platforms than others. Strong candidates may also have experience with: Experience working on and building operating systems, browsers, or deeply OS-integrated software (screensharing, video-calling, game engines, etc) Experience integrating and working with AI/ML models and understanding their capabilities Demonstrated success implementing cross-platform development strategies Vision for the future of AI-powered desktop applications and a drive to make that vision a reality Have experience with IPC (Inter-Process Communication) and security in desktop applications Deadline to apply: None. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis. The expected base compensation for this position is below. Our total compensation package for full-time employees includes equity, benefits, and may include incentive compensation.Annual Salary:$320,000 - $405,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time.

Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.Role Summary A systems-level engineer specializing in network infrastructure and network optimization, with expertise in building and maintaining software that interacts with networks. You will be responsible for writing and maintaining software that interfaces between our accelerators and our high-speed networks. This role requires deep technical knowledge of network protocols, kernel-space and/or user-space networks, interfacing with hardware, and the ability to debug and optimize distributed software at the network level. You may be a good fit if you have: Networking Systems Engineering: Expert-level proficiency with network protocols and networking concepts Deep kernel networking: TCP/IP stack internals, XDP, eBPF, io_uring, and epoll User-space networking: DPDK, RDMA, kernel bypass techniques Understanding of how to build higher-level abstractions like collectives and RPC Skilled at diagnosing and resolving networking issues in distributed systems, especially at OSI model layers 2-4 Low-Level Systems and OS Programming: Strong programming skills in a systems programming language, including memory management, lock-free data structures, and NUMA-aware programming Software, driver, and OS performance optimization tools and techniques Comfort with or desire to learn Rust Strong candidates may have: Understanding of ML accelerators and accelerator drivers Demonstrated ability to design new network protocols Experience with PCIe and drivers for PCIe devices Expertise in algorithms used in networking, including compression and graph algorithms Experience programming on SmartNICs 5+ years of experience in systems programming or network programming Often comes from backgrounds in: HPC, telecommunications, host networking software, OS/kernel engineering, or embedded systems Strong debugging mindset with patience for complex, multi-layered issues Representative Projects: Build a system for accelerator-initiated tensor movement over the network Benchmark software for a new networking environment Implement a new collective algorithm to improve latency Optimize congestion control algorithms for large-scale synchronous workloads Debug kernel-level network latency spikes The expected base compensation for this position is below.

However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research.
