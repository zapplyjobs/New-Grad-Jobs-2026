How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

Approximately two months prior to the start of your internship, we will match you with one of our four core operational pillars—Procurement, Global Operations, Supply Chain, or Fulfillment. This timing allows us to align your work with the most critical real-time business needs while considering your specific interests and skillset.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What You&#39;ll Do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Your core responsibility will be leading 1–2 strategic projects focused on improving a critical part of the business. Beyond project work, you will also have exposure to the day-to-day operations of your selected group, gaining hands-on experience in running a global supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Depending on your specific placement, your project scope and daily focus will cover:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Procurement:&lt;/strong&gt; You may lead projects on supplier selection or structuring strategic deals. Your day-to-day will involve exposure to negotiations and vendor management.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global Operations:&lt;/strong&gt; You may drive a project on logistics strategy or international expansion. Your day-to-day exposure will likely involve managing 3PL partnerships and freight operations.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supply Chain:&lt;/strong&gt; You may scope a project improving production management or inbound/reverse logistics. In your daily role, you will see how we handle demand/supply planning to balance inventory.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fulfillment:&lt;/strong&gt; You may tackle a project regarding distribution network logic or order processing efficiency. Day-to-day, you will be exposed to the workflows that drive our customer service experience.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What You Bring&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Currently enrolled in a full-time MBA program graduating in 2027.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ability to work at Verkada HQ (San Mateo, CA) for Summer 2026.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;High-impact self-starter: you take initiative to move projects forward and can operate well with little guidance.

Previous Salesforce experience is a plus.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Communication and stakeholder management: you&#39;ll need to be able to connect with sales reps and hardware engineers alike to figure out how we build the right processes and workflows to drive efficiency while also giving us the data to measure how we&#39;re doing. Strong written and verbal communication skills are a must.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Flexibility and hustle: you manage change and ambiguity well, and have no problems juggling multiple priorities while executing in a fast-paced environment. You’re comfortable pivoting quickly and often.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;3+ years of professional experience with a passion for Supply Chain and Operations&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US Benefits&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Verkada is committed to investing in the holistic health and wellbeing of all employees.
