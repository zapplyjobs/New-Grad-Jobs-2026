    "description": "&lt;div class=&quot;content-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ready to be pushed beyond what you think you’re capable of?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At Coinbase, our mission is to increase economic freedom in the world. It’s a massive, ambitious opportunity that demands the best of us, every day, as we build the emerging onchain platform — and with it, the future global financial system.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To achieve our mission, we’re seeking a very specific candidate. We want someone who is passionate about our mission and who believes in the power of crypto and blockchain technology to update the financial system. We want someone who is eager to leave their mark on the world, who relishes the pressure and privilege of working with high caliber colleagues, and who actively seeks feedback to keep leveling up. We want someone who will run towards, not away from, solving the company’s hardest problems.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coinbase.com/mission&quot;&gt;work culture&lt;/a&gt; is intense and isn’t for everyone. But if you want to build the future alongside others who excel in their disciplines and expect the same from you, there’s no better place to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While many roles at Coinbase are remote-first, we are not remote-only. In-person participation is required throughout the year. Team and company-wide offsites are held multiple times annually to foster collaboration, connection, and alignment. Attendance is expected and fully supported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Client Strategist (CS) team is a key function within Coinbase Asset Management (CBAM). At CBAM a CS’s job is to build the business. This includes engaging prospects and developing them into clients (if appropriate).&amp;nbsp; At CBAM a Client Strategist is a hybrid between a salesperson and an investment strategist. A successful Client Strategist can secure the next 2-3 meetings during the initial conversation, and drive a deal towards funding. Post funding, Client Strategists design and deliver investor support, in concert with CBAM’s Director of Marketing and IR. A Strategist must understand the nuances of our business, such that they can represent the investment team and our investment process across regions. Client Strategists also contribute to marketing content, turning client feedback and market intelligence into better marketing narratives and better marketing collateral.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you’ll be doing (ie. job duties):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;50-70%: Supporting outbound selling of CBAM funds and strategies in North America, Europe, Asia as led by the firm’s President.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;20-40%: Driving outbound selling of CBAM funds and strategies to institutional allocators across US Wealth, RIA, Family Office.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Research, propose, and execute Go-To_Market (GTM).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Develop deep relationships with and understanding of Institutional Allocators (Pensions, Sovereign Wealth Fund, Endowments, Foundations,&amp;nbsp; Wealth platforms, HNW and UHNW).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Drive maintenance and growth of the CBAM client base.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;10%-20%: Assisting in creation and maintenance of marketing collateral, in concert with the head of Marketing &amp;amp; IR.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we look for in you (ie. job requirements):&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;7+ years of institutional sales experience at top tier global institutional asset manager.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Significant experience independently building relationships with Institutional Allocators.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;In particular, this role needs experience with allocators, RIAs, Wealth platforms in the US and EU, especially Wealth (Multi-family and Single Family offices).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with, and ability to describe, investment concepts across Macro, Systematic, Private Credit, and Fundamental strategies.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Strong working knowledge of digital assets, blockchain technology, crypto market structure, and an ability to drive interest in digital asset investment strategies.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Demonstrated capability to operate independently, to be flexible and to be relentless.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;An ability to receive and give hard feedback.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Technical curiosity, deep interest in digital assets, markets, innovative technology.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Working familiarly with Bloomberg, Excel, Powerpoint &amp;amp; Salesforce.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nice to haves:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Technical skills beyond above: ai, coding, python, statistical analysis.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Working understanding of crypto that can be demonstrated in high pressure meetings.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Professional investment designations: CFA, CAIA.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Strong understanding of region marketing rules and regulations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Series 3 or 7.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Role requires substantial travel.

    "job_description": "&lt;div class=&quot;content-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ready to be pushed beyond what you think you’re capable of?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At Coinbase, our mission is to increase economic freedom in the world. It’s a massive, ambitious opportunity that demands the best of us, every day, as we build the emerging onchain platform — and with it, the future global financial system.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To achieve our mission, we’re seeking a very specific candidate. We want someone who is passionate about our mission and who believes in the power of crypto and blockchain technology to update the financial system. We want someone who is eager to leave their mark on the world, who relishes the pressure and privilege of working with high caliber colleagues, and who actively seeks feedback to keep leveling up. We want someone who will run towards, not away from, solving the company’s hardest problems.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coinbase.com/mission&quot;&gt;work culture&lt;/a&gt; is intense and isn’t for everyone. But if you want to build the future alongside others who excel in their disciplines and expect the same from you, there’s no better place to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While many roles at Coinbase are remote-first, we are not remote-only. In-person participation is required throughout the year. Team and company-wide offsites are held multiple times annually to foster collaboration, connection, and alignment.

You will contribute to unique, large scale, highly complex product problems. You will help researchers, designers, and product managers craft thoughtful experiences to help enable all people to engage with the crypto economy. You don’t need to be an expert on cryptocurrency to join us—we welcome folks at many different moments in their cryptocurrency journey. We only ask that you have a basic knowledge of cryptocurrency and Coinbase’s role in it, and an interest in learning more.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you’ll be doing (ie. job duties):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Work on one or more research projects with other researchers, designers, and product managers to investigate a product problem or area&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Learn how to plan and execute research to solve complex and ambiguous product problems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Craft one or more research reports to clearly communicate your findings and make impactful design and product recommendations for the team&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we look for in you (ie. job requirements):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Actively seeking a career in user research&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Working knowledge of general research principles (experimental design, bias, confounds, etc.) and UX research principles (usability testing, design thinking, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Self-motivated and committed to personal growth&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Approach problems with positive energy&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nice to haves:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Currently pursuing a degree or certificate in a research-related field or pursuing user research extracurricularly while enrolled in a Bachelors program&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Enjoy thinking about how people interact with products, with a natural curiosity to understand others’ mental models and motivations&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Application Requirements:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final report from a past research project:&lt;/strong&gt; This can be a school, bootcamp, or consulting/extracurricular project.

    "job_description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the Role We're looking for experienced software engineers to join teams focused on automating vertical use cases using Claude, particularly in financial services and healthcare. The two teams currently hiring are: Financial Services: From data retrieval and analysis to predictive intelligence and institutional-quality report generation, we are creating AI experiences that meet the unique standards of the world's largest financial institutions, including investment banks, hedge funds, and asset managers. Healthcare: From clinical documentation and prior authorization to care coordination, quality reporting, and patient management, these AI experiences need to balance solving critical challenges for healthcare systems, physicians, and patients while ensuring accuracy and compliance requirements. In both teams, you will work closely with research, product, design, and go-to-market teams to deliver products that drive adoption and retention of Claude. Core Responsibilities Develop deep understanding of critical workflows in these verticals and build novel AI solutions to address the needs of our most important customers Design and build enterprise-grade products with high standards for security, reliability, and regulatory compliance Develop features that enable Claude to learn from workflow patterns, market feedback loops, and process transformation data unique to these verticals Work closely with research teams, including post-training, to ensure Claude is uniquely capable of enabling complex workflows in these areas You Might Be a Good Fit If You Have 8+ years of experience as a product-minded software engineer, with curiosity and genuine interest in financial services or healthcare domains Strong communication skills and ability to work effectively across functions in a fast-moving environment Strong Candidates May Also Have Experience integrating and working with AI/ML models and understanding their capabilities, particularly for financial or healthcare use cases Startup experience, particularly in building products from zero to one Deadline to apply: None. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis.The expected base compensation for this position is below. Our total compensation package for full-time employees includes equity, benefits, and may include incentive compensation.Annual Salary:$320,000 - $485,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

    "description": "&lt;div class=&quot;content-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Anthropic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re looking for experienced software engineers to join teams focused on automating vertical use cases using Claude, particularly in financial services and healthcare. The two teams currently hiring are:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Financial Services: &lt;/strong&gt;From data retrieval and analysis to predictive intelligence and institutional-quality report generation, we are creating AI experiences that meet the unique standards of the world&#39;s largest financial institutions, including investment banks, hedge funds, and asset managers.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Healthcare: &lt;/strong&gt;From clinical documentation and prior authorization to care coordination, quality reporting, and patient management, these AI experiences need to balance solving critical challenges for healthcare systems, physicians, and patients while ensuring accuracy and compliance requirements.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In both teams, you will work closely with research, product, design, and go-to-market teams to deliver products that drive adoption and retention of Claude.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core Responsibilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Develop deep understanding of critical workflows in these verticals and build novel AI solutions to address the needs of our most important customers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Design and build enterprise-grade products with high standards for security, reliability, and regulatory compliance&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Develop features that enable Claude to learn from workflow patterns, market feedback loops, and process transformation data unique to these verticals&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Work closely with research teams, including post-training, to ensure Claude is uniquely capable of enabling complex workflows in these areas&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Be a Good Fit If You Have&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;8+ years of experience as a product-minded software engineer, with curiosity and genuine interest in financial services or healthcare domains&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Strong communication skills and ability to work effectively across functions in a fast-moving environment&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong Candidates May Also Have&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience integrating and working with AI/ML models and understanding their capabilities, particularly for financial or healthcare use cases&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Startup experience, particularly in building products from zero to one&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deadline to apply:&lt;/strong&gt; None. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expected&amp;nbsp;base compensation for this position is below. Our total compensation package for full-time employees includes equity, benefits, and may include incentive compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Annual Salary:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-range&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$320,000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;divider&quot;&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;$485,000 USD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logistics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education requirements: &lt;/strong&gt;We require at least a Bachelor&#39;s degree in a related field or equivalent experience.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Location-based hybrid policy:&lt;/strong&gt; Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",
