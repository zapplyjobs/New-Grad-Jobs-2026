From go-to-market planning for new products and features, to creating the content that enables our sales team and educates our users, you’ll touch on all areas of the business and help drive Datadog’s growth. We give our Product Marketing Managers the opportunity to collaborate, investigate, experiment and idealize how we can gear our product to yield the highest results.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We’re looking for a Product Marketing Manager to lead the go-to-market strategy for CloudPrem, partnering closely with Product, Sales, and GTM teams to bring this offering to market, differentiate it in a competitive space, and drive adoption among enterprise and regulated-industry customers&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;CloudPrem is Datadog’s hybrid log management solution built for organizations with strict data residency or regulatory requirements.
