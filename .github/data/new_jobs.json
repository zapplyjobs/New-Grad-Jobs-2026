The compliance team uses this understanding to provide direction to internal partners on the priorities of security and safety requirements they must meet. The compliance team assures regulators and customers that those expectations are met by earning security credentials and responding to direct inquiry about Anthropics security program from auditors, customers and partners. This opportunity is unique, as we work to secure today’s most novel and valuable asset types, we must build a new kind of compliance program, assuring the safety of artificial intelligence capabilities. Responsibilities: Build and scale Anthropic's Customer Trust function, establishing processes, tooling, and team structure to support enterprise customer requirements Experiment with and implement automation solutions to streamline customer due diligence, improve response times, and scale operations as customer volume grows Establish and lead the Customer Audit function, creating scalable processes to efficiently manage incoming customer security assessments, audits, and contract reviews Define metrics and reporting frameworks to track team performance, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency Understand how Anthropic's security and privacy capabilities across major cloud platforms implement common frameworks (e.g., NIST 800-53, NIST 800-171, ISO 27001, ISO 27701, CSA CCM, and SOC 2) You may be a good fit if you: ​​Have 8+ years of progressive experience in compliance, audit, and customer trust roles, with direct ownership of building or scaling customer-facing security operations from early-stage through high-growth Have strong customer-facing expertise with proven success managing security audits, questionnaires, and building trust with enterprise customers Are entrepreneurial with strong operational instincts — you identify broken processes, envision scalable solutions, and implement the right tools to maximize efficiency without sacrificing quality Have managed high volumes of customer security requests in cloud-native, multi-cloud environments and understand what \"good\" looks like at scale Are comfortable organizing delegated workstreams across diverse teams and managing time-bounded deliverables Have worked with Revenue Operations or Deal Desk teams in scaling sales programs with a focus on security and safety.

However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us.

Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.
