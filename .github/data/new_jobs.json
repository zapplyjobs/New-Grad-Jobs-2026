They will work closely with Product Managers and Engineers to identify bottlenecks, streamline workflows, enhance decision-making processes, and scale our Product’s impact. Working as an extension of the product leadership team, they will balance hands-on tactical execution with strategic initiatives, bringing a pragmatic eye for scale and operationalization in a fit-for-purpose way. The Claude Code team has revolutionized the way people build software. They are a scrappy team that is obsessed with users and have fostered an incredible iterative feedback loop. Given the high demand, the scale of impact is really exciting for this team and the Operator that joins to help accelerate growth. The ideal candidate will be hands-on and have experience building and operationalizing end-to-end product delivery.

You likely tinker to make tools and products yourself A track record of building processes and programs from 0 to 1 and scaling them thoughtfully Strong cross-functional partnership skills with ability to influence without authority Strong analytical skills with the ability to translate complex qualitative and quantitative data into actionable insights with clear recommendations Success managing complex, multi-stakeholder initiatives in fast-paced, ambiguous environments Experience with launch coordination, early access programs, or customer feedback loops A passion for iterative, user-driven product development Experience as a bridge builder who connects strategy to execution and creates alignment across teams. You are a problem seeker comfortable with ambiguity and skilled at creating structure where none exists. The annual compensation range for this role is below. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.

However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us.

Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.
