However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the role As a Designer for Claude Developer Platform at Anthropic, you'll shape how developers experience our API products—from the Console and documentation to Workbench and beyond. This role focuses on the core developer platform, including: Make building and maintaining high-quality applications with the Anthropic API frictionless. Support frontier capabilities and API features via tooling, workflows, and documentation. Design best-in-class admin experiences for API utilities like billing, usage, and access management. Define the future suite of utilities for developers to confidently build, monitor and control agentic systems. As a designer at Anthropic, you’ll work alongside product managers, engineers, and AI researchers to shape experiences that transform Claude from a tool into a trusted collaborator: We design products that solve real problems by combining deep understanding of user needs with our unique perspective on LLMs. Design plays a critical role in building transformative AI systems that feel reliable, interpretable, and trustworthy. Designers give shape to our vision for tremendous human progress through AI. We leverage unique skills like storytelling and prototyping to communicate ideas and their feasibility. We execute on interaction and visual details with a high degree of polish, focusing on shipping, learning, and continuous improvement. Read more here for the type of features we build. Responsibilities: Contribute to the strategic direction of our tools, rooted in deep user empathy Define feature areas with exceptional attention to detail and polish, identifying opportunities to improve quality and consistency of broader flows Craft beautiful, polished, and delightful user interfaces that build trust and showcase the power of our AI technology Collaborate with product managers, engineers, AI researchers and other stakeholders to define product vision, strategy and roadmaps Rapidly prototype ideas using code and other methods to communicate concepts and build excitement Find creative ways to ship high-quality work in a fast-paced, often ambiguous, resource-constrained startup environment You may be a good fit if you have: 8+ years of product design experience (experience designing complex workflows, enterprise/B2B SaaS, developer tools, or API products preferred) Strong portfolio showcasing user-centric design thinking, polished UI craftsmanship, and innovative interaction paradigms Proven track record of executing end-to-end on large and complex products or a series of products in ambiguous environments Excellent collaboration and communication skills to work effectively with cross-functional teams and influence without authority Passion for crafting scaled, highly impactful, safe and beneficial artificial intelligence technologies to enable new possibilities Experience with prototyping, especially using front-end code (e.g. HTML/CSS/JS) preferred Strong candidates may: Ship opinionated products and make things customers want. Model a builder mindset to explore and communicate through prototyping and design. Build trust with users through craft and connection.

Our total compensation package for full-time employees includes equity and benefits.Annual Salary:$260,000 - $305,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us.

How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

    "job_description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the Role We're building the infrastructure that enables Claude to act in the world—booking travel, writing code, calling APIs, managing files, and completing multi-step tasks autonomously. This is foundational work for the next generation of AI capabilities. The Agent Infrastructure team designs and operates the execution environments, state management systems, and security boundaries that make autonomous AI agents safe and reliable. You'll work at the intersection of distributed systems, security engineering, and product—building systems that don't exist anywhere else in industry. This is a high-priority initiative. The problems are hard, the scope is greenfield, and the impact is immediate. What You'll Do Design and build sandboxed compute environments where Claude can safely execute code, access tools, and interact with external services Build state management systems for long-running agent tasks—handling checkpoints, recovery, and resumption across failures Develop authentication and authorization frameworks for delegated access—enabling Claude to act on behalf of users securely Create observability and debugging tools for agent execution—understanding what Claude did, why, and how to make it better Partner closely with product and research teams to define what's possible and ship it You May Be a Good Fit If You Have 6+ years of experience building distributed systems, infrastructure, or platform services at the hyper scale Comfortable building Cloud Native infrastructure on GCP, AWS, or Azure Care deeply about security, isolation, and building systems that fail safely Have experience with containers, sandboxing, or secure execution environments (e.g., gVisor, Firecracker, V8 isolates) Are comfortable with ambiguity—this is greenfield work, and you'll help define the architecture Write clean, maintainable code in Python, Go, Rust, or similar Want to work on problems that don't have existing playbooks Strong Candidates May Have Experience building multi-tenant execution platforms or serverless infrastructure Background in security engineering, sandboxing, or isolation technologies Familiarity with workflow orchestration systems (Temporal, Airflow, Step Functions) Experience with state machines, checkpointing, or durable execution patterns Low-level systems experience (Linux internals, eBPF, container runtimes) The annual compensation range for this role is below. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. Our total compensation package for full-time employees includes equity and benefits.Annual Salary:$320,000 - $485,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.
