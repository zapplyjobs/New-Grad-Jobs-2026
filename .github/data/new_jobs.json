    "job_description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.Anthropic’s Audio team pushes the boundaries of what's possible with audio with large language models. We care about making safe, steerable, reliable systems that can understand and generate speech and audio, prioritizing not only naturalness but also steerability and robustness. As a researcher on the Audio team, you'll work across the full stack of audio ML, developing audio codecs and representations, sourcing and synthesizing high quality audio data, training large-scale speech language models and large audio diffusion models, and developing novel architectures for incorporating continuous signals into LLMs. Our team focuses primarily but not exclusively on speech, building advanced steerable systems spanning end-to-end conversational systems, speech and audio understanding models, and speech synthesis capabilities. The team works closely with many collaborators across pretraining, finetuning, reinforcement learning, production inference, and product to get advanced audio technologies from early research to high impact real-world deployments. You may be a good fit if you: Have hands-on experience with training audio models, whether that's conversational speech-to-speech, speech translation, speech recognition, text-to-speech, diarization, codecs, or generative audio models Genuinely enjoy both research and engineering work, and you'd describe your ideal split as roughly 50/50 rather than heavily weighted toward one or the other Are comfortable working across abstraction levels, from signal processing fundamentals to large-scale model training and inference optimization Have deep expertise with JAX, PyTorch, or large-scale distributed training, and can debug performance issues across the full stack Thrive in fast-moving environments where the most important problem might shift as we learn more about what works Communicate clearly and collaborate effectively; audio touches many parts of our systems, so you'll work closely with teams across the company Are passionate about building conversational AI that feels natural, steerable, and safe Care about the societal impacts of voice AI and want to help shape how these systems are developed responsibly Strong candidates may also have experience with: Large language model pretraining and finetuning Training diffusion models for image and audio generation Reinforcement learning for large language models and diffusion models End-to-end system optimization, from performance benchmarking to kernel optimization GPUs, Kubernetes, PyTorch, or distributed training infrastructure Representative projects: Training state-of-the art neural audio codecs for 48 kHz stereo audio Developing novel algorithms for diffusion pretraining and reinforcement learning Scaling audio datasets to millions of hours of high quality audio Creating robust evaluation methodologies for hard-to-measure qualities such as naturalness or expressiveness Studying training dynamics of mixed audio-text language models Optimizing latency and inference throughput for deployed streaming audio systems The annual compensation range for this role is listed below. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.Annual Salary:$350,000 - $500,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;About the Role:&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As Data Operations Manager for Computer Use &amp;amp; Tool Use, you&#39;ll build and scale data operations that advance Claude&#39;s computer use capabilities and tool use safety. You&#39;ll partner with research teams to design and execute data strategies, manage vendor relationships, and own the entire data pipeline from requirements to production. This is a zero-to-one role requiring technical depth to understand what makes high-quality training data for autonomous agents, but your focus will be on strategy and execution rather than hands-on engineering. Think technical founder who evolved from writing code to building the business.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;About the Impact:&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The data strategies and operations you build will directly determine how well Claude can use tools safely, operate computers autonomously, and maintain quality across long-horizon agentic workflows. You&#39;ll work with world-class researchers advancing frontier capabilities, safety, and model performance while building the operational infrastructure to scale these efforts.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re looking for someone who gets excited about the challenge of scaling quality for complex, multi-turn agent interactions - someone who can think strategically about data needs for both capabilities and safety, build the right partnerships, and execute flawlessly. If you thrive at the intersection of technical depth and operational excellence, we&#39;d love to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Responsibilities:&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Develop and execute data strategies for computer use, tool use safety, and agentic AI research&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Partner with research leaders to translate technical requirements into operational frameworks&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build data collection and evaluation systems for complex scenarios: prompt injection robustness, multi-turn agent conversations, adversarial attacks, autonomous workflows&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Scale the generation of realistic evaluation environments that capture real-world tool use and computer use challenges&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Identify, evaluate, and manage specialized contractors and vendors for technical data collection&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Implement quality control processes to ensure data meets training requirements for both capabilities and safety&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Manage multiple complex projects simultaneously, balancing research velocity with rigorous evaluation standards&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Track metrics and communicate progress to stakeholders&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;You may be a good fit if you:&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have 3+ years in technical operations, product management, or entrepreneurial experience building from zero to scale&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have strong technical foundations - proficiency in Python and understanding of ML workflows, RL environments, and evaluation frameworks&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have strong communication skills and can effectively engage with both technical and non-technical stakeholders&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are familiar with how LLMs work and could describe concepts like RLHF, tool use, and agentic workflows&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Understand the unique challenges of evaluating autonomous systems and long-horizon agent behaviors&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are highly organized and can manage multiple parallel workstreams effectively&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have a high threshold for navigating ambiguity and can balance strategic priorities with rapid execution&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Thrive in fast-paced research environments with shifting priorities and novel technical challenges&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are passionate about AI safety and understand the critical importance of high-quality data in building safe, capable agentic systems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Strong candidates may also have:&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience at companies training AI models, building AI agents, or creating AI training data, evaluations, or environments&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Knowledge of computer and tool use safety challenges like prompt injection, data exfiltration attempts, or adversarial attacks&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience with RLHF, reinforcement learning techniques, or similar human-in-the-loop training methods&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Domain expertise in computer use automation, security, or AI safety evaluation&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with model performance monitoring, training observability, or quality assessment systems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Track record of building and scaling operations teams&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The annual compensation range for this role is listed below.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (&quot;OTE&quot;) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Annual Salary:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-range&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$250,000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;divider&quot;&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;$365,000 USD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logistics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education requirements: &lt;/strong&gt;We require at least a Bachelor&#39;s degree in a related field or equivalent experience.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Location-based hybrid policy:&lt;/strong&gt; Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time.

    "job_description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the role In this role on the Applied AI team, you will lead the delivery of transformational AI solutions for Fortune 500 enterprises. You'll own high-value engagements where we collaborate directly with customers to build tailored AI agents for their most critical business processes. You will own end-to-end delivery from signed SOW through production deployment, orchestrating cross-functional teams including Engineering, Product, Design, and customer stakeholders. This is not project management—you'll navigate complex enterprise environments, remove technical and organizational blockers, and ensure we deliver measurable business outcomes while maintaining our high standards for safety and reliability. You'll work hand-in-hand with Forward Deployed Engineers (FDEs) who handle core technical delivery, while you own stakeholder management, delivery cadence, and organizational complexity. You'll champion our mission in the field while building the playbooks and processes that enable us to scale this emerging motion. Responsibilities: Draft Statements of Work (SOWs) alongside engineers, structuring engagements with clear scope, milestones, and success criteria. Participate in technical discovery sessions to understand customer requirements and inform engagement design. Own AI product building end-to-end: maintain and adjust roadmaps as scope evolves, identify and work through blockers, and help the team navigate delivery challenges. Drive engagement delivery from SOW signature through production deployment, ensuring milestones are met, blockers are removed, and stakeholders are aligned. Partner closely with FDEs: manage organizational complexity and facilitate their access to customer stakeholders and systems. Orchestrate cross-functional teams: coordinate Engineering, Product/Design resources, and customer teams to deliver integrated solutions on time and within scope. Manage stakeholder relationships: maintain regular cadence with customer executive sponsors, technical leads, and procurement while surfacing issues and celebrating wins. Lead delivery operations: run sprint ceremonies, milestone reviews, and progress reporting; translate technical complexity into executive-level updates. Navigate enterprise complexity: work through security reviews, legal approvals, procurement processes, and organizational dynamics that can block progress. Manage scope and change: handle scope changes, set expectations, and negotiate contract modifications when needed. Identify risks early and develop mitigation strategies; know when to escalate to leadership and provide clear context when doing so. Serve as the first line of escalation for FDEs and customer stakeholders; resolve conflicts before they impact delivery. Document engagement patterns, create repeatable frameworks, and contribute to the operational infrastructure that enables growth. Travel as needed to customer sites to build relationships, unblock issues, and demonstrate Anthropic's commitment (25-50% travel expected). You May Be a Good Fit If You Have: 5+ years of experience in technical program management, engagement management, or delivery leadership in professional services, consulting, or enterprise software. Track record delivering complex technical projects for Fortune 500 clients, ideally large-scale engagements with multiple workstreams. Strong technical acumen with ability to understand AI/ML concepts, software architecture, and enterprise systems (you don't need to code, but must be able to translate between technical and business stakeholders). Executive presence with ability to present to C-suite sponsors and navigate enterprise organizational dynamics. High agency with demonstrated ability to remove blockers, make decisions with incomplete information, and drive progress through ambiguity. Exceptional communication skills for managing diverse stakeholders, running effective meetings, and producing clear status reporting. Process design mindset with ability to create structure where none exists while remaining flexible to emerging patterns. High cooperation orientation for balancing competing priorities across customer needs, engineering capacity, and product strategy. Minimum Bachelors Degree in Computer Science or related field. Strong Plus: Experience in financial services, healthcare/life sciences, or pharma verticals. Background at a Forward Deployed Engineering company or Big 3 / Big 4 professional services and consulting firms. Exceptional understanding of LLM capabilities and limitations. Experience with regulated industries and compliance requirements. Experience managing delivery teams with embedded engineers at customer sites. Familiarity with agile/scrum methodologies in client-facing delivery contexts. The annual compensation range for this role is listed below. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.Annual Salary:$200,000 - $300,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time.

How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.
