    "job_description": "Airtable is the no-code app platform that empowers people closest to the work to accelerate their most critical business processes. More than 500,000 organizations, including 80% of the Fortune 100, rely on Airtable to transform how work gets done.Airtable stores some of our customers' most valuable operational data. Because we’re the system customers use to power some of their most important collaborative operational workflows, much of this data only exists in Airtable. This data is often combined with data from other organizational systems of record in structured ways. All together, that means we have an incredibly differentiated body of context about our customers that can power insights about their business that they couldn’t get anywhere else. Today, getting value from all of this data requires builder skills. We want to make insights about this data accessible to anyone through natural language. This area of our AI product investment is relatively early, and we believe it represents a significant opportunity across three dimensions: Enterprise leverage: Our most mature bases are in enterprise accounts. These contain years of historical campaigns, product feedback, roadmaps, call transcripts. These customers are already bought in on Airtable as their operational data layer. AI-powered analysis lets them extract dramatically more value without additional building. Non-builder expansion: Today, you need to be a builder to get value from Airtable. Analysis and Q&A is the most accessible entry point for the much larger population of collaborators, consumers, and executives who will never create a view or write a formula but who have questions about their data. Becoming the business context repository: There's an untapped opportunity for individuals to proactively bring together data from different tools explicitly to create personal or team context repositories that AI can reason over. What you'll do Define the opportunity space and shape what AI-powered analysis and synthesis looks like for Airtable. Own the AI-powered search, Q&A, and analysis experience by building conversational interfaces that let users query, synthesize, and generate insights from their operational data without needing to be Airtable experts Drive AI adoption among non-builders by expanding who benefits from Airtable by creating AI experiences that surface value for users who never touch the builder Build the intelligence layer that keeps Airtable in the loop as AI agents and external systems interact with Airtable data, ensure our AI capabilities deliver superior context-aware responses Shape how quantitative analysis works in an AI-native context leveraging Airtable's unique position as a structured, flexible, composable data store Collaborate cross-functionally with engineering, design, and data teams to ship high-quality AI experiences that users trust and rely on daily Who you are Experience building AI chat/assistant products: you've shipped conversational AI, copilot, or Q&A experiences and understand the nuances of prompt engineering, context management, retrieval, and user trust in AI-generated outputs 8+ years of product management experience: you have a track record of shipping products that users love, ideally including AI/ML-powered features at scale Genuine AI fluency: you understand how LLMs work at a technical level (not just as a user), can evaluate tradeoffs between model capabilities, and have opinions on RAG architectures, fine-tuning, evals, and prompt design Strong product taste for AI interactions: you have a refined sense for what makes AI responses feel helpful vs. frustrating, when to show confidence vs. uncertainty, and how to build trust through transparency Comfort with ambiguity: you're energized by defining problems, not just solving well-scoped ones. You can make progress when a roadmap doesn't exist yet. Analytical rigor: you fluent enough with AI and data to define success metrics for AI features and build measurement frameworks for inherently fuzzy outcomes Technical depth: you can partner effectively with engineers to drive the priority and importance of architecture decisions and infrastructure investments User empathy: you understand how non-technical users think about their data and can translate complex capabilities into intuitive experiences Airtable is an equal opportunity employer.

More than 500,000 organizations, including 80% of the Fortune 100, rely on Airtable to transform how work gets done.Join Airtable as a Product Security Engineer and play a pivotal role in shaping the security of our rapidly evolving platform as we expand our AI and LLM-powered offerings. You will join the team responsible for safeguarding the application layer of Airtable’s platform. You will partner closely with product engineering teams to build paved roads, frameworks, and automated controls that make the secure path the easy path for our engineering teams. You will help influence application security at scale, ensuring our products are secure by design. What you'll do Develop self-service security frameworks and \"paved roads\" that allow engineering teams to ship secure code by default. Focus on automated guardrails for common vulnerabilities, while prioritizing deep-dive design reviews into complex business logic and data isolation issues (for example, multi-tenant isolation and authorization/permission bypasses) that automated tools cannot catch. Partner with product and engineering teams to review designs early, contribute to threat modeling for new features and complex initiatives, and provide clear, actionable security guidance. Research emerging threats and evolving best practices, specifically regarding AI and LLM safety, and implement controls to secure these workflows. Manage and evolve our approach to external penetration testing and bug bounties, driving remediation for findings and treating vulnerability management as an engineering problem. Contribute to the long-term roadmaps, metrics, and strategic planning for the product security team. (Senior/Staff L5+) Lead complex threat modeling sessions for major product launches and define secure coding standards, and actively mentor other engineers to raise the technical security bar across the organization. Who you are 4+ years of experience in product security or application security, with experience shipping production code. Please note this is not an early career position. You have a strong background in computer science or a related field, with proficiency in writing clean, maintainable code. You have deep familiarity with JavaScript or TypeScript, Node.js, and modern web application frameworks, and can reason about the security implications of systems built on them. You have hands-on experience securing LLM integrations and identifying prompt injection or data leakage risks. You are proficient in writing and reviewing code and treat security as an engineering problem to be solved with software, not just policies. You excel at communicating complex security risks to non-security stakeholders and enjoy collaborating cross-functionally to find solutions that balance security with engineering velocity. You are comfortable working in a fast-paced environment, navigating ambiguity, continuously learning about emerging threats and technologies, and contributing to long-term security strategy.

More than 500,000 organizations, including 80% of the Fortune 100, rely on Airtable to transform how work gets done.Airtable is looking for a Senior Manager, Enterprise Marketing Programs to build and own our enterprise pipeline marketing engine. This role owns the vision and execution of systemically converting in-market signals into qualified sales conversations through experimental and robust marketing programs. What you'll do In this role, you'll create qualified sales pipeline through two complementary approaches: (1) building broad demand generation programs using solutions messaging to attract enterprise buyers at scale through channels like webinars, paid media, email, and events, and (2) hunting and activating high-propensity accounts by identifying product usage signals that indicate upgrade readiness. You will identify and engage existing Airtable champions with targeted programs—whether with relevant solutions, or expansion/upsell messaging. You'll design and execute these programs, partnering with sales on outbound plays, competitive campaigns, and new motions. This role requires someone who can both architect the strategy, execute the programs, and measure what's working—you'll own building the enterprise pipeline marketing engine from the ground up. That means running multiple programs simultaneously, partnering across teams (PMM, sales, creative, digital, events), drafting your own messaging and content to test, designing experiments to learn what converts, and making real-time decisions about where to invest. Experimentation is how you’ll learn fast and discover what drives enterprise revenue at scale. Core Responsibilities Generate qualified enterprise pipeline through integrated marketing programs aligned to Airtable's priority GTM plays Accelerate time-to-conversation by optimizing engagement models, messaging, and channel strategies across email, paid, events, and social Draft messaging, content, and creative briefs to test what converts—partnering with PMM, creative, and agencies to scale what works Convert product signals into enterprise opportunities by identifying and activating accounts showing enterprise characteristics through solutions-led programming Build the repeatable pipeline engine - design, test, and scale programs that systematically turn GTM plays into revenue Drive marketing-sales alignment by representing Demand Gen in cross-functional GTM meetings, partnering on outbound programs, and building tight feedback loops that improve targeting and performance Who you are Experience: 8-10+ years in B2B enterprise marketing with deep expertise in integrated program design and execution Strong understanding of PLG -> enterprise motions and proven track record generating measurable pipeline and revenue Experience with sales plays and outbound marketing motions. ABM experience a nice to have. Background working closely with product marketing on GTM launches and optimizing funnel metrics Experience with Airtable or similar no-code AI platforms; genuine enthusiasm for building with and using AI in your work Solutions marketing, vertical marketing, or PLG-to-Enterprise experience highly valued How You Work: Extremely independent operator who thrives in ambiguity Bias to action: you ship fast, learn fast, and iterate Experimental mindset: design tests, kill what doesn't work, double down on what does Takes extreme ownership—you design it, build it, run it, measure it, improve it Strong cross-functional collaboration skills; ability to influence without authority What Makes This Role Unique This isn't about running the playbook—it's about writing it in real-time. Airtable's PLG model generates thousands of high-intent product signals daily, and your job is to design the programs that convert those signals into enterprise pipeline at scale. You'll need to figure out what works, often with incomplete information, and be willing to scrap what doesn't. We're looking for someone who doesn't just market the product—you use it. If you're energized by building in the unknown, measure success in pipeline generated (not just programs launched), and move fast—this role is for you. Airtable is an equal opportunity employer.
