Public Warning: Recruitment Phishing Scam Impersonating EKN Engineering EKN Engineering has become aware of a phishing scheme targeting individuals with fraudulent interview requests and job offers. EKN’s secure IT systems and private applicant information have not been compromised; scammers are impersonating EKN employees, using the company name and branding to mislead and engage potential job seekers in fake recruitment processes. Scammers might reference real job openings or describe fake opportunities that generally match individuals’ professional backgrounds, with the goal of establishing communication and eventually obtaining private financial information to defraud people. The Federal Bureau of Investigation and Federal Trade Commission warn that employment scams such as this are a growing cyber threat. EKN urges anyone who is contacted about employment opportunities to exercise caution and know that: All communication from EKN Engineering will be from an EKN employee using the @eknengineering.com email domain. We do not use third-party recruiters. EKN Engineering recruiters will only schedule interviews for candidates who have applied for a position through our secure portal.

Large-scale language models are evolving from clever chatbots into powerful engines of linguistic and cultural understanding. With high-quality training data, tomorrow’s AI can democratize education, accelerate research, and support global communication across languages and contexts. That training data begins with you—we need your expertise to help power the next generation of AI. We’re looking for Japanese speakers who understand the nuances of grammar, usage, spelling, tone, and cultural context in both formal and informal Japanese. You’ll challenge advanced AI models with linguistic edge cases, cultural subtleties, translation ambiguities, and phrasing differences—documenting model failures and guiding improvements with clarity and precision. On a typical day, you will engage in text-based conversations with the model, evaluate its responses for accuracy and fluency, annotate linguistic patterns, test comprehension across a range of Japanese language inputs, and suggest refinements to prompts and evaluation methods. A background in linguistics, translation, writing, localization, or teaching is ideal. Experience with Japanese language instruction, editing, or QA is a strong signal of fit. Clear communication and a reflective approach to language—explaining not just what is correct, but why—is essential. Ready to turn your Japanese fluency into the foundation for tomorrow’s AI? Apply today and help train the model that will teach the world.
