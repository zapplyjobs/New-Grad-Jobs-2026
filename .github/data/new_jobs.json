Large-scale language models are transforming the way we learn, work, and communicate—moving beyond simple tasks into tools that can support education, research, and professional practice across industries. With high-quality training data, tomorrow’s AI can become smarter, more reliable, and more useful for people everywhere. That training data begins with you. We’re looking for motivated individuals who are eager to contribute to the development of cutting-edge AI systems. You’ll work hands-on with advanced AI tools, test model outputs, evaluate responses for accuracy and clarity, and provide structured feedback to strengthen model performance. On a typical day, you will engage with AI across a wide range of topics, review its responses for quality, document errors or gaps, and collaborate with our team to refine prompts, tasks, and evaluation methods. Your ability to think critically, spot inconsistencies, and communicate feedback clearly will directly influence how well the model learns. No prior AI or technical experience is required—this is an opportunity to begin at the ground floor of AI, and we will teach you what you need to know. This flexible engagement is a strong fit for students, recent graduates, seasonal or part-time workers, and career switchers who bring curiosity, strong communication skills, and a detail-oriented mindset. Experience in research, writing, tutoring, customer support, or problem-solving is a plus—but not required. Ready to launch your career in AI by helping train the systems that will shape the future? Apply today and start turning your skills into impact. We offer a pay range of $6-to-$65 per hour, with the exact rate determined after evaluating your experience and geographic location. Final offer amounts may vary from the pay range listed above.
