However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.

But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day.

At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco.

    "description": "&lt;div class=&quot;content-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discord is used by over 200 million people every month for many different reasons, but there’s one thing that nearly everyone does on our platform:&lt;strong&gt; play video games.&lt;/strong&gt; Over 90% of our users play games, spending a combined 1.5 billion hours playing thousands of unique titles on Discord each month. Discord plays a uniquely important role in the future of gaming. We are focused on making it easier and more fun for people to talk and hang out before, during, and after playing games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;More broadly, Discord is about empowering people to find belonging in all kinds of communities, and those people trust us to keep their communications safe. Our Platform Security Engineering team protects the systems we use to create Discord, making the “secure way” the “easy way.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We’re looking for a Senior Engineer to advance this mission through security expertise, software development, and operational excellence. In this role, you’ll help identify leveraged opportunities to reduce security risk across Engineering and then you’ll design and deliver technical solutions—lovable “paved paths” for managing identities and access, shipping code, configuring cloud infrastructure, and operating services.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you’re a security engineer who’s deeply curious, eager to own technically and socially complex projects, and excited to improve security and privacy at Discord, read on!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you&#39;ll do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Own software engineering projects end-to-end on a highly-autonomous and horizontally-integrated team with a lot of leverage. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is a code-forward role!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Develop and apply best-in-class secure baselines for cloud infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Secure first- and third-party software supply chains, from the dev environment through CI/CD and into production.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Build and operate identity and access management (IAM) systems that are user-friendly and promote least privilege.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Manage infrastructure vulnerabilities while supporting rapid growth for Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Consult on risk assessments, architectural designs, threat models, code reviews, and more—pragmatically balancing security with other business considerations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example projects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Support IAM with scalable platform solutions (check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://discord.com/blog/access-a-new-portal-for-managing-internal-authorization&quot;&gt;https://discord.com/blog/access-a-new-portal-for-managing-internal-authorization&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build tooling to prevent and address vulnerabilities across our infrastructure.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Integrate service-to-service authentication and authorization into Discord’s internal developer platform.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we look for&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;5+ years of experience building and operating production systems or infrastructure&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;3+ years of experience writing software in a general-purpose programming language (we mainly use Python, Typescript, and Rust)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;3+ years of experience securing systems with millions of users&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Experience designing and building software for customers (internal or external) beyond your immediate team&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Experience securing multi-cloud environments (e.g. GCP, Cloudflare, AWS)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Experience defining and orchestrating containers (e.g. via Kubernetes, Docker, Distroless, OCI)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Familiarity with build and CI/CD technologies (e.g. Terraform, Bazel, Buildkite)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Understanding of modern authentication and authorization concepts (e.g. RBAC, OAuth, Zero Trust network architectures, mTLS)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus points if you have…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Developed and debugged distributed systems atop GCP and Cloudflare&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Led complex migrations or risk management programs across an engineering organization&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Built or operated a service mesh (e.g. Envoy, Istio)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Managed and secured VMs or bare-metal hosts (e.g. Linux, Salt)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Practices to discover industry tools and knowledge that can multiply your team’s impact&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The US base salary range for this full-time position is $196,000 to $220,500 + equity + benefits.

How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.
