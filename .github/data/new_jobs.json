    "job_description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the Role Our goal is to build AI that millions of people use every day—to think, create, learn, and accomplish what matters to them. As Head of Consumer Product at Anthropic, you will be a key strategic leader driving our consumer product vision and bringing Claude to everyone. We're looking for an exceptional product leader who has built consumer products at scale, deeply understands what makes experiences intuitive and indispensable, ships products that people love and tell their friends about, and is eager to dive into everything from interaction design to retention strategy. The best candidates will be extremely hands-on, obsessed with user experience, and opinionated about a future where AI genuinely improves people's daily lives. You'll work on new consumer experiences at the frontier of what's possible with AI. You'll partner with research, design, and engineering to translate breakthrough model capabilities into products people actually want to use. Ultimately you'll help us build the AI assistant that millions of people choose for their most important work and creative pursuits. Responsibilities: Strategic Leadership: Own the complete vision for how consumers experience Claude—from core chat interactions to new modalities, features, and form factors that make AI useful across every context of daily life. User Champion: Deeply understand what drives people to try, love, and recommend Claude. Build feedback systems that surface user needs, identify friction, and inform product priorities. Drive sustainable growth through product excellence. Consumer Product Excellence: Ship experiences that feel considered: intuitive interactions, thoughtful defaults, and capabilities that surprise and delight. Obsess over the details that create products people love—onboarding flows, error states, performance, and polish. Product Execution at Scale: Partner with engineering and design on products serving millions of daily users. Navigate the unique challenges of consumer AI: managing user expectations, building trust, ensuring safety, and creating experiences that work for everyone from students to professionals to casual users. Research Partnership: Work closely with research to identify which model capabilities will most delight users. Partner with trust & safety to build products that are both capable and responsible. Collaborate with marketing and communications to tell Claude's story authentically. You may be a good fit if you have: 10+ years of progressive experience in product management, including at least 5 years in senior roles leading consumer products Track record of building consumer products with millions of users that people genuinely love Appreciation for the responsibility that comes with building AI products people rely on daily Deep experience with consumer growth, retention, and engagement and opinions about what metrics actually matter Strong design sensibility and experience partnering closely with design teams on consumer experiences Experience building products where user trust and safety are core to the value proposition Experience with AI or ML-powered products and a perspective on how AI will change consumer software Demonstrated success building and leading high-performing product teams Comfort with ambiguity and the ability to define product direction in a fast-moving, novel space User-obsessed mindset with a habit of talking to users directly and frequently Experience across multiple platforms (web, mobile, desktop) and an understanding of how context shapes product design The annual compensation range for this role is listed below. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.Annual Salary:$385,000 - $460,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.
