    "job_description": "About us Parallel is a web infrastructure company. Our products are used by leading businesses in sales, marketing, insurance, and coding to build best-in-class AI agents with flexible and powerful programmatic access to the web. We've raised $130 million from Kleiner Perkins, Index Ventures, Spark Capital, Khosla Ventures, First Round, and Terrain to build the web for AIs. We're forming a world-class team of engineers, designers, marketers, sellers, researchers, and operational experts to achieve our mission. About you You're a researcher who thinks like an engineer, or an engineer who thinks like a researcher. You've worked on information retrieval systems, embedding models, or neural ranking at scale, or you're deeply curious about the fundamental problems that emerge when training models to understand and serve billions of web documents. You thrive in the space between theory and production, where elegant solutions must also run efficiently on real infrastructure. You're comfortable reading papers from SIGIR and RecSys one day and debugging distributed training pipelines the next. The role You'll design and train the models that power Parallel's APIs: the intelligence layer that helps AI agents find exactly what they need from the open web. This means tackling research problems that most labs encounter only at hyperscale: How do you train embedding models that capture semantic intent across diverse query types? How do you balance model expressiveness with sub-second retrieval latency? How do you maintain index freshness when the web updates constantly, without rebuilding from scratch? Unlike traditional search engines built for human queries, you're building for AI agents that issue complex, multi-hop queries and expect structured, programmatic responses. This is information retrieval reimagined for the LLM era, work that combines classical IR techniques with modern deep learning, applied at a scale that demands new solutions. Life at Parallel Our team works fully in-person , between our Palo Alto HQ and San Francisco office. We’re a flat, talent-dense organization dedicated to solving technical and creative problems. We seek like-minded individuals who share our passion for applying science, creativity, and consistency to big and complex problems with equally big outcomes. These are our values: Own customer impact: It’s on us to ensure real-world outcomes for our customers. Obsess over craft: Perfect every detail because quality compounds. Accelerate change : Ship fast, adapt faster, and move frontier ideas into production. Create win-wins : Creatively turn trade-offs into upside. Make high-conviction bets : Try and fail. But succeed an unfair amount.

We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.

If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.
