Blissway is a startup that simplifies the collection of tolls and greatly improves highway safety. In a way, we are multiple startups in one: deep tech, AI/ML, fintech, hardware, SaaS, IoT, transportation, and GovTech. For the past five years we have built a nearly insurmountable software &amp; hardware technological lead in tolling and highway safety, under-the-radar industries that are bigger than football.

We have extremely talented SWE team members who want you to learn and succeed. They will guide you but this would be a bad fit if you are hoping a training program, you must throw yourself at the problems. If you want to learn more, let's talk!",
