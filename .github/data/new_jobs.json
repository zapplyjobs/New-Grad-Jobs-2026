    "job_description": "Airtable is the no-code app platform that empowers people closest to the work to accelerate their most critical business processes. More than 500,000 organizations, including 80% of the Fortune 100, rely on Airtable to transform how work gets done.Airtable is looking for a Senior Manager, Enterprise Marketing Programs to build and own our enterprise pipeline marketing engine. This role owns the vision and execution of systemically converting in-market signals into qualified sales conversations through experimental and robust marketing programs. What you'll do In this role, you'll create qualified sales pipeline through two complementary approaches: (1) building broad demand generation programs using solutions messaging to attract enterprise buyers at scale through channels like webinars, paid media, email, and events, and (2) hunting and activating high-propensity accounts by identifying product usage signals that indicate upgrade readiness. You will identify and engage existing Airtable champions with targeted programs—whether with relevant solutions, or expansion/upsell messaging. You'll design and execute these programs, partnering with sales on outbound plays, competitive campaigns, and new motions. This role requires someone who can both architect the strategy, execute the programs, and measure what's working—you'll own building the enterprise pipeline marketing engine from the ground up. That means running multiple programs simultaneously, partnering across teams (PMM, sales, creative, digital, events), drafting your own messaging and content to test, designing experiments to learn what converts, and making real-time decisions about where to invest. Experimentation is how you’ll learn fast and discover what drives enterprise revenue at scale. Core Responsibilities Generate qualified enterprise pipeline through integrated marketing programs aligned to Airtable's priority GTM plays Accelerate time-to-conversation by optimizing engagement models, messaging, and channel strategies across email, paid, events, and social Draft messaging, content, and creative briefs to test what converts—partnering with PMM, creative, and agencies to scale what works Convert product signals into enterprise opportunities by identifying and activating accounts showing enterprise characteristics through solutions-led programming Build the repeatable pipeline engine - design, test, and scale programs that systematically turn GTM plays into revenue Drive marketing-sales alignment by representing Demand Gen in cross-functional GTM meetings, partnering on outbound programs, and building tight feedback loops that improve targeting and performance Who you are Experience: 8-10+ years in B2B enterprise marketing with deep expertise in integrated program design and execution Strong understanding of PLG -> enterprise motions and proven track record generating measurable pipeline and revenue Experience with sales plays and outbound marketing motions. ABM experience a nice to have. Background working closely with product marketing on GTM launches and optimizing funnel metrics Experience with Airtable or similar no-code AI platforms; genuine enthusiasm for building with and using AI in your work Solutions marketing, vertical marketing, or PLG-to-Enterprise experience highly valued How You Work: Extremely independent operator who thrives in ambiguity Bias to action: you ship fast, learn fast, and iterate Experimental mindset: design tests, kill what doesn't work, double down on what does Takes extreme ownership—you design it, build it, run it, measure it, improve it Strong cross-functional collaboration skills; ability to influence without authority What Makes This Role Unique This isn't about running the playbook—it's about writing it in real-time. Airtable's PLG model generates thousands of high-intent product signals daily, and your job is to design the programs that convert those signals into enterprise pipeline at scale. You'll need to figure out what works, often with incomplete information, and be willing to scrap what doesn't. We're looking for someone who doesn't just market the product—you use it. If you're energized by building in the unknown, measure success in pipeline generated (not just programs launched), and move fast—this role is for you. Airtable is an equal opportunity employer.

    "job_description": "Airtable is the no-code app platform that empowers people closest to the work to accelerate their most critical business processes. More than 500,000 organizations, including 80% of the Fortune 100, rely on Airtable to transform how work gets done.Airtable’s infrastructure is evolving to meet the needs of our fast growing engineering org. We are looking for backend engineers to join our team to help improve critical product infrastructure, with a focus on building systems that have a great developer experience and will scale as we grow. We currently have openings on: Base Infrastructure: The Base Infrastructure team owns the system that powers the core of Airtable’s product--serving Airtable bases. We are investing in the foundations of our homegrown in-memory database. Key projects include building replication to support zero downtime failovers, optimizing performance and memory usage, and vertical scaling. Compute: The compute pod builds and manages our Kubernetes-based platform that supports every service at Airtable, including all new AI services such as vector databases, AI evals store, and document extraction and understanding services. We have a lot of exciting foundational work in our roadmap, such as Overhauling our network stack and service discovery, to simplify service setup and strengthen security Region level disaster recovery, and bringing up compute platform from 0->1 in a new region Building custom Kubernetes operators for reliably managing some of our most critical workloads Data Infrastructure: The Data Infrastructure team’s mission is to enable data-driven decision making at Airtable by providing reliable, self-service, high-performance analytics infrastructure. We use technologies like Apache Spark, Kafka, and Apache Flink to process vast quantities of data in our data warehouse. This infrastructure is used by Airtable’s data engineers and analysts, as well as product developers building features powered by business data.The team is focused on scaling to petabyte volume, enabling sub-second streaming, tightening data governance, and delivering cost efficient ML-ready datasets to power Airtable’s native AI products with fresh, high quality signals. Developer Platform: The Developer Platform team sits at the intersection of all engineering at Airtable, focusing on building the internal tooling, frameworks, and CI/CD systems that power our product teams. We strive to streamline developer workflows—from build and test cycles to production deployments—and foster a best-in-class developer experience. Join us if you’re passionate about creating high-leverage solutions that enable engineers to deliver features quickly, reliably, and at scale. Storage: The Storage team’s mission is to accelerate product development at Airtable by providing scalable, reliable, and easy-to-use storage abstractions. We use RDS MySQL, DynamoDB, Redis, and TiDB. We’re looking for folks interested in distributed systems and databases who are excited to work on business-critical, petabyte-scale storage systems. You will own all aspects of building, running, and improving these systems, from the underlying infrastructure all the way to the developer-facing code abstractions. Traffic: We are looking for founding members of our Traffic Engineering team. We recently formed a Traffic Infrastructure team to ensure that traffic across Airtable’s network and routing infrastructure is managed in a reliable, flexible, and secure manner. This will support improved performance in our secondary regions (EU and Australia) as well as other customer-driven projects. We are looking for software engineers experienced in shipping code in the areas of cloud network routing, network security, and traffic engineering. Please note: while we employ a hybrid working model at Airtable (flexible in working from the office or elsewhere), we are only hiring in the following locations at this time: Based in the San Francisco Bay Area and are open to coming into our office (Embarcadero) at least ~2-3 times/week for team collaboration Based in New York City and are open to coming into our office (Soho) at least ~2-3 times/week for team collaboration Based remotely in the greater Seattle area What you'll do Proactively identify and lead significant improvements to Airtable’s infrastructure, working across teams and product areas to maximize business and engineering impact.
