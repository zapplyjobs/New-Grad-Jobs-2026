How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

AI Product Specialist vs. AI Forward Deployed Engineer - What's the Difference? The AI Product Specialist is more internal-facing, part of a centralized team using the Regal AI Agent Platform to build and test AI agents, codifying best practices and processes for AI Agent development and QA testing, and giving feedback to our product and engineering teams on how the platform needs to evolve (as well as building demos for the sales and marketing teams and working on internal projects). AI Product Specialists have a technical degree, but only 0-2 years of previous experience. The AI Forward Deployed Engineer is more customer-facing, owning the launch and overall success of each AI Agent deployment and customer relationship, ensuring AI Agents can successfully integrate into the customer’s existing systems and workflows and achieve their business goals (as well as growing revenue by identifying more use cases and opportunities for AI Agents). AI Forward Deployed Engineers have 3+ years in a technical customer-facing role (e.g., Solutions Engineer, Implementation Consultant) or have PM experience in a tech environment.BENEFITS/PERKS:We care about your health!
