More than 500,000 organizations, including 80% of the Fortune 100, rely on Airtable to transform how work gets done. The Opportunity Airtable lets teams build custom apps to run their operations without writing code. Hundreds of thousands of organizations use it to manage everything from product launches to customer pipelines to content calendars. We're in the middle of a fundamental shift in how people build and interact with software. AI is changing what's possible: users can describe what they want in natural language and get working applications. They can create intelligent agents that take actions on their behalf. The floor for who can build powerful software is dropping fast. We're hiring PMs to join the team building Airtable's AI-native future. Our current areas of focus include: AI-assisted app building: helping users go from intent to working application through natural language Intelligent agents: enabling users to create AI agents that take actions on their data, from enriching records to automating workflows Analysis & synthesis: making the data in Airtable accessible through natural language Q&A and insights These areas are early, high-ownership, and central to Airtable's product strategy. You'll help define what AI-native software building looks like.

    "job_description": "Airtable is the no-code app platform that empowers people closest to the work to accelerate their most critical business processes. More than 500,000 organizations, including 80% of the Fortune 100, rely on Airtable to transform how work gets done.Airtable stores some of our customers' most valuable operational data. Because we’re the system customers use to power some of their most important collaborative operational workflows, much of this data only exists in Airtable. This data is often combined with data from other organizational systems of record in structured ways. All together, that means we have an incredibly differentiated body of context about our customers that can power insights about their business that they couldn’t get anywhere else. Today, getting value from all of this data requires builder skills. We want to make insights about this data accessible to anyone through natural language. This area of our AI product investment is relatively early, and we believe it represents a significant opportunity across three dimensions: Enterprise leverage: Our most mature bases are in enterprise accounts. These contain years of historical campaigns, product feedback, roadmaps, call transcripts. These customers are already bought in on Airtable as their operational data layer. AI-powered analysis lets them extract dramatically more value without additional building. Non-builder expansion: Today, you need to be a builder to get value from Airtable. Analysis and Q&A is the most accessible entry point for the much larger population of collaborators, consumers, and executives who will never create a view or write a formula but who have questions about their data. Becoming the business context repository: There's an untapped opportunity for individuals to proactively bring together data from different tools explicitly to create personal or team context repositories that AI can reason over. What you'll do Define the opportunity space and shape what AI-powered analysis and synthesis looks like for Airtable. Own the AI-powered search, Q&A, and analysis experience by building conversational interfaces that let users query, synthesize, and generate insights from their operational data without needing to be Airtable experts Drive AI adoption among non-builders by expanding who benefits from Airtable by creating AI experiences that surface value for users who never touch the builder Build the intelligence layer that keeps Airtable in the loop as AI agents and external systems interact with Airtable data, ensure our AI capabilities deliver superior context-aware responses Shape how quantitative analysis works in an AI-native context leveraging Airtable's unique position as a structured, flexible, composable data store Collaborate cross-functionally with engineering, design, and data teams to ship high-quality AI experiences that users trust and rely on daily Who you are Experience building AI chat/assistant products: you've shipped conversational AI, copilot, or Q&A experiences and understand the nuances of prompt engineering, context management, retrieval, and user trust in AI-generated outputs 8+ years of product management experience: you have a track record of shipping products that users love, ideally including AI/ML-powered features at scale Genuine AI fluency: you understand how LLMs work at a technical level (not just as a user), can evaluate tradeoffs between model capabilities, and have opinions on RAG architectures, fine-tuning, evals, and prompt design Strong product taste for AI interactions: you have a refined sense for what makes AI responses feel helpful vs. frustrating, when to show confidence vs. uncertainty, and how to build trust through transparency Comfort with ambiguity: you're energized by defining problems, not just solving well-scoped ones. You can make progress when a roadmap doesn't exist yet. Analytical rigor: you fluent enough with AI and data to define success metrics for AI features and build measurement frameworks for inherently fuzzy outcomes Technical depth: you can partner effectively with engineers to drive the priority and importance of architecture decisions and infrastructure investments User empathy: you understand how non-technical users think about their data and can translate complex capabilities into intuitive experiences Airtable is an equal opportunity employer.
