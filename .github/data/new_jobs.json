With high-quality training data, tomorrow’s AI can deliver accurate, context-aware translations, enhance cross-cultural communication, and support learners and professionals around the world. That training data begins with you—we need your expertise to help power the next generation of AI. We’re looking for Hebrew translators with a strong command of both Hebrew and English who can assess and refine AI-generated translations for grammatical accuracy, fluency, cultural nuance, and context sensitivity. You’ll challenge the model with idiomatic expressions, ambiguous phrases, formal and informal tones, and real-world scenarios—documenting model failures and providing insight to improve translation quality and consistency. On a typical day, you will evaluate and edit AI outputs, translate between Hebrew and English in both directions, annotate errors, provide cultural or contextual explanations, and suggest improvements to prompts, evaluation methods, and model behavior. A background in professional translation, linguistics, localization, or language education is ideal. Experience with technical, literary, or media translation is a strong signal of fit. Clear, reflective communication and an ability to articulate translation decisions are essential. Ready to turn your translation expertise into the foundation for tomorrow’s AI? Apply today and help train the model that will teach the world. We offer a pay range of $8 to $65 per hour, with the exact rate determined after evaluating your experience, expertise, and geographic location. Final offer amounts may vary from the pay range listed above.
