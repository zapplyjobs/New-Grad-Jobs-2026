    "job_description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.Anthropic is seeking a Training Content and Systems Architect to build the systems and content that enable others to teach Claude effectively at scale. You'll own the single source of truth for trainer-facing materials and build AI-augmented processes that keep that content current, consistent, and high-quality across dozens of contexts simultaneously. This means designing content architectures that are modular enough for AI-assisted adaptation, building automated quality loops that flag drift or staleness, and creating tooling that lets a single educator operate at the output level that historically required a full enablement team. You'll also embed with internal teams and strategic partners to understand real trainer needs — then translate those needs into systems, not just slide decks. If you love the puzzle of making one person's work multiply through smart systems design, and you're excited about using AI not as a topic you teach but as the infrastructure through which you teach, this is the role. About Anthropic Anthropic is an AI safety and research company that's working to build reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our customers and for society as a whole. Our interdisciplinary team has experience across ML, physics, policy, business and product. Responsibilities: Maintain the single source of truth for all trainer-facing content — decks, speaker notes, facilitator guides, demo libraries, exercises — and build AI-augmented workflows for keeping it current as Claude's capabilities evolve Design modular content architectures that enable AI-assisted adaptation for different audiences, contexts, and locales without manual rework for each variant Create turnkey champion success packets that enable enterprise champions and partner trainers to run effective internal rollouts with minimal involvement from the education team Build automated quality and consistency checks — rubrics, spot-check processes, drift detection — that maintain Anthropic's standards as content flows through distributed training networks Embed with internal and partner enablement champions to understand what's working, what's missing, and what's changing, then systematize those insights into content updates Partner with our Certification Education Lead to ensure training content aligns with assessment and credentialing requirements Develop and track metrics on content adoption, trainer confidence, and downstream learner outcomes You may be a good fit if you have: 5+ years in enablement, train-the-trainer programs, or learning & development with a systems-building orientation — you think about how to make content maintainable and scalable, not just how to create it Experience creating training content for developers and other technical audiences Experience building and maintaining training content libraries at scale — specifically, building the systems that govern content, not just the content itself A working practice of using AI tools (Claude, LLMs broadly) as core infrastructure in your own workflows — you naturally reach for AI to solve operational and content problems rather than treating it as an occasional assistant Technical fluency sufficient to work confidently with APIs, SDKs, and code-based documentation; this isn't an engineering role, but you should be unintimidated by technical content and comfortable building light tooling or automations Strong instructional design instincts and a passion for continual improvement in how people learn Clear, structured thinking about how to make complex material accessible and how to make that accessibility repeatable Comfort operating in ambiguous, fast-moving environments where you'll build processes from scratch and design them to run with minimal human overhead Strong candidates may also have: Experience building AI-augmented content pipelines or using LLMs for content generation, review, or adaptation at scale Familiarity with LMS platforms, content management systems, or training infrastructure A track record of working cross-functionally with sales, customer success, and partner teams while maintaining an educator's perspective Prior work at a high-growth technology company navigating rapid product change Experience with certification programs or credentialing from the educational content side The annual compensation range for this role is listed below. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.Annual Salary:$1 - $2 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains.

How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

    "description": "&lt;div class=&quot;content-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Anthropic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is seeking a Training Content and Systems Architect to build the systems and content that enable others to teach Claude effectively at scale.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You&#39;ll own the single source of truth for trainer-facing materials and build AI-augmented processes that keep that content current, consistent, and high-quality across dozens of contexts simultaneously. This means designing content architectures that are modular enough for AI-assisted adaptation, building automated quality loops that flag drift or staleness, and creating tooling that lets a single educator operate at the output level that historically required a full enablement team. You&#39;ll also embed with internal teams and strategic partners to understand real trainer needs — then translate those needs into systems, not just slide decks.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you love the puzzle of making one person&#39;s work multiply through smart systems design, and you&#39;re excited about using AI not as a topic you teach but as the infrastructure through which you teach, this is the role.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Anthropic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is an AI safety and research company that&#39;s working to build reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our customers and for society as a whole. Our interdisciplinary team has experience across ML, physics, policy, business and product.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Maintain the single source of truth for all trainer-facing content — decks, speaker notes, facilitator guides, demo libraries, exercises — and build AI-augmented workflows for keeping it current as Claude&#39;s capabilities evolve&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Design modular content architectures that enable AI-assisted adaptation for different audiences, contexts, and locales without manual rework for each variant&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Create turnkey champion success packets that enable enterprise champions and partner trainers to run effective internal rollouts with minimal involvement from the education team&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Build automated quality and consistency checks — rubrics, spot-check processes, drift detection — that maintain Anthropic&#39;s standards as content flows through distributed training networks&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Embed with internal and partner enablement champions to understand what&#39;s working, what&#39;s missing, and what&#39;s changing, then systematize those insights into content updates&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Partner with our Certification Education Lead to ensure training content aligns with assessment and credentialing requirements&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Develop and track metrics on content adoption, trainer confidence, and downstream learner outcomes&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You may be a good fit if you have:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;5+ years in enablement, train-the-trainer programs, or learning &amp;amp; development with a systems-building orientation — you think about how to make content maintainable and scalable, not just how to create it&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Experience creating training content for developers and other technical audiences&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Experience building and maintaining training content libraries at scale — specifically, building the systems that govern content, not just the content itself&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A working practice of using AI tools (Claude, LLMs broadly) as core infrastructure in your own workflows — you naturally reach for AI to solve operational and content problems rather than treating it as an occasional assistant&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Technical fluency sufficient to work confidently with APIs, SDKs, and code-based documentation; this isn&#39;t an engineering role, but you should be unintimidated by technical content and comfortable building light tooling or automations&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Strong instructional design instincts and a passion for continual improvement in how people learn&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Clear, structured thinking about how to make complex material accessible and how to make that accessibility repeatable&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Comfort operating in ambiguous, fast-moving environments where you&#39;ll build processes from scratch and design them to run with minimal human overhead&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong candidates may also have:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Experience building AI-augmented content pipelines or using LLMs for content generation, review, or adaptation at scale&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Familiarity with LMS platforms, content management systems, or training infrastructure&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A track record of working cross-functionally with sales, customer success, and partner teams while maintaining an educator&#39;s perspective&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Prior work at a high-growth technology company navigating rapid product change&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Experience with certification programs or credentialing from the educational content side&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The annual compensation range for this role is listed below.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (&quot;OTE&quot;) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Annual Salary:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-range&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;divider&quot;&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;$2 USD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logistics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education requirements: &lt;/strong&gt;We require at least a Bachelor&#39;s degree in a related field or equivalent experience.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Location-based hybrid policy:&lt;/strong&gt; Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses.
