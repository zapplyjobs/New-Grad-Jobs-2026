We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.

We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

    "job_description": "Airtable is the no-code app platform that empowers people closest to the work to accelerate their most critical business processes. More than 500,000 organizations, including 80% of the Fortune 100, rely on Airtable to transform how work gets done.Airtable’s infrastructure is evolving to meet the needs of our fast growing engineering org. We are looking for backend engineers to join our team to help improve critical product infrastructure, with a focus on building systems that have a great developer experience and will scale as we grow. We currently have openings on: Base Infrastructure: The Base Infrastructure team owns the system that powers the core of Airtable’s product--serving Airtable bases. We are investing in the foundations of our homegrown in-memory database. Key projects include building replication to support zero downtime failovers, optimizing performance and memory usage, and vertical scaling. Compute: The compute pod builds and manages our Kubernetes-based platform that supports every service at Airtable, including all new AI services such as vector databases, AI evals store, and document extraction and understanding services. We have a lot of exciting foundational work in our roadmap, such as Overhauling our network stack and service discovery, to simplify service setup and strengthen security Region level disaster recovery, and bringing up compute platform from 0->1 in a new region Building custom Kubernetes operators for reliably managing some of our most critical workloads Data Infrastructure: The Data Infrastructure team’s mission is to enable data-driven decision making at Airtable by providing reliable, self-service, high-performance analytics infrastructure. We use technologies like Apache Spark, Kafka, and Apache Flink to process vast quantities of data in our data warehouse. This infrastructure is used by Airtable’s data engineers and analysts, as well as product developers building features powered by business data.The team is focused on scaling to petabyte volume, enabling sub-second streaming, tightening data governance, and delivering cost efficient ML-ready datasets to power Airtable’s native AI products with fresh, high quality signals. Developer Platform: The Developer Platform team sits at the intersection of all engineering at Airtable, focusing on building the internal tooling, frameworks, and CI/CD systems that power our product teams. We strive to streamline developer workflows—from build and test cycles to production deployments—and foster a best-in-class developer experience. Join us if you’re passionate about creating high-leverage solutions that enable engineers to deliver features quickly, reliably, and at scale. Storage: The Storage team’s mission is to accelerate product development at Airtable by providing scalable, reliable, and easy-to-use storage abstractions. We use RDS MySQL, DynamoDB, Redis, and TiDB. We’re looking for folks interested in distributed systems and databases who are excited to work on business-critical, petabyte-scale storage systems. You will own all aspects of building, running, and improving these systems, from the underlying infrastructure all the way to the developer-facing code abstractions. Traffic: We are looking for founding members of our Traffic Engineering team. We recently formed a Traffic Infrastructure team to ensure that traffic across Airtable’s network and routing infrastructure is managed in a reliable, flexible, and secure manner. This will support improved performance in our secondary regions (EU and Australia) as well as other customer-driven projects. We are looking for software engineers experienced in shipping code in the areas of cloud network routing, network security, and traffic engineering. Please note: while we employ a hybrid working model at Airtable (flexible in working from the office or elsewhere), we are only hiring in the following locations at this time: Based in the San Francisco Bay Area and are open to coming into our office (Embarcadero) at least ~2-3 times/week for team collaboration Based in New York City and are open to coming into our office (Soho) at least ~2-3 times/week for team collaboration Based remotely in the greater Seattle area What you'll do Proactively identify and lead significant improvements to Airtable’s infrastructure, working across teams and product areas to maximize business and engineering impact. Work on systems-level problems in a complex design space where scalability, efficiency, reliability, and security really matter. Build clean, reusable, and maintainable abstractions that will be used by Airtable’s engineers for years to come. Take full ownership of components of Airtable’s infrastructure, including responsibility for reliability, performance, efficiency, and observability of our production environment. Who you are You have 2-8 years of industry experience, and are excited about learning new technologies and applying them in a fast-changing environment. Please note this is not a new grad position. You have experience in areas such as databases, distributed systems, service-oriented architectures, and data infrastructure. You derive joy from refactoring and building clean abstractions in order to make complex systems fun to develop on and easy to understand. You have a strong background in computer science with a degree in CS or a related field. You are currently based or willing to relocate to the San Francisco Bay Area.

We use technologies like&amp;nbsp; Apache Spark, Kafka, and Apache Flink to process vast quantities of data in our data warehouse. This infrastructure is used by Airtable’s data engineers and analysts, as well as product developers building features powered by business data.&lt;br&gt;The team is focused on scaling to petabyte volume, enabling sub-second streaming, tightening data governance, and delivering cost efficient ML-ready datasets to power Airtable’s native AI products with fresh, high quality signals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developer Platform&lt;/strong&gt;: The Developer Platform team sits at the intersection of all engineering at Airtable, focusing on building the internal tooling, frameworks, and CI/CD systems that power our product teams. We strive to streamline developer workflows—from build and test cycles to production deployments—and foster a best-in-class developer experience. Join us if you’re passionate about creating high-leverage solutions that enable engineers to deliver features quickly, reliably, and at scale.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Storage&lt;/strong&gt;: The Storage team’s mission is to accelerate product development at Airtable by providing scalable, reliable, and easy-to-use storage abstractions.
