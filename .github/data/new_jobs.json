    "job_description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.Anthropic’s Audio team pushes the boundaries of what's possible with audio with large language models. We care about making safe, steerable, reliable systems that can understand and generate speech and audio, prioritizing not only naturalness but also steerability and robustness. As a researcher on the Audio team, you'll work across the full stack of audio ML, developing audio codecs and representations, sourcing and synthesizing high quality audio data, training large-scale speech language models and large audio diffusion models, and developing novel architectures for incorporating continuous signals into LLMs. Our team focuses primarily but not exclusively on speech, building advanced steerable systems spanning end-to-end conversational systems, speech and audio understanding models, and speech synthesis capabilities. The team works closely with many collaborators across pretraining, finetuning, reinforcement learning, production inference, and product to get advanced audio technologies from early research to high impact real-world deployments. You may be a good fit if you: Have hands-on experience with training audio models, whether that's conversational speech-to-speech, speech translation, speech recognition, text-to-speech, diarization, codecs, or generative audio models Genuinely enjoy both research and engineering work, and you'd describe your ideal split as roughly 50/50 rather than heavily weighted toward one or the other Are comfortable working across abstraction levels, from signal processing fundamentals to large-scale model training and inference optimization Have deep expertise with JAX, PyTorch, or large-scale distributed training, and can debug performance issues across the full stack Thrive in fast-moving environments where the most important problem might shift as we learn more about what works Communicate clearly and collaborate effectively; audio touches many parts of our systems, so you'll work closely with teams across the company Are passionate about building conversational AI that feels natural, steerable, and safe Care about the societal impacts of voice AI and want to help shape how these systems are developed responsibly Strong candidates may also have experience with: Large language model pretraining and finetuning Training diffusion models for image and audio generation Reinforcement learning for large language models and diffusion models End-to-end system optimization, from performance benchmarking to kernel optimization GPUs, Kubernetes, PyTorch, or distributed training infrastructure Representative projects: Training state-of-the art neural audio codecs for 48 kHz stereo audio Developing novel algorithms for diffusion pretraining and reinforcement learning Scaling audio datasets to millions of hours of high quality audio Creating robust evaluation methodologies for hard-to-measure qualities such as naturalness or expressiveness Studying training dynamics of mixed audio-text language models Optimizing latency and inference throughput for deployed streaming audio systems The annual compensation range for this role is listed below. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.Annual Salary:$350,000 - $500,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.

We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us.

In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

It’s a big mission, and that’s where you come in!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At Duolingo, you’ll join a team that cares about educating our users, experimenting with big ideas, making fact-based decisions, and finding innovative solutions to complex problems. You’ll have limitless learning opportunities and daily collaborations with world-class minds — while doing work that’s both meaningful and fun.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Join our life-changing mission to develop education for our half a billion (and growing!) learners around the world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Read &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.duolingo.com/?utm_source=greenhouse.com&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=generalblog_gh_091224&quot;&gt;our blog&lt;/a&gt; to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the role...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Scaling Operations is Duolingo’s 1-to-a-billion function. We turn promising ideas into reliable, scalable systems so teams can move faster without multiplying headcount or complexity. As a Senior Scaling Operations Program Manager, you’ll be an embedded operational and strategic partner who owns cross-functional programs from ambiguity to impact. You will design and run workflows, align engineering, product, and content partners, and measure what matters so we can launch faster, scale smarter, and increase quality with less effort. This role is based in Pittsburgh, PA or New York City, NY.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:brain: You will...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Lead high-leverage, cross-functional programs from definition through launch and scale, creating clarity in ambiguous problem spaces and driving decisions across stakeholders in Engineering, Learning &amp;amp; Curriculum, and Product.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Design and implement durable, tech-forward workflows and standards that reduce manual effort and enable reliable, repeatable execution at scale.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Orchestrate execution across multiple teams, sequencing dependencies, managing risk, and establishing SLAs, KPIs, and operating cadences that keep programs on track.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build decision frameworks and business cases that balance impact, scale, cost, complexity, and confidence; model tradeoffs and recommend paths forward.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Shrink “time to launch” and “time to scale” by introducing process improvements, documentation, and tooling that pave the road behind each release.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Partner closely with engineering to mature systems for stability, observability, and resilience; define specs and roadmaps where needed to support scale.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Align functions early and often to surface risks, close context gaps, and reduce surprises; serve as the connective tissue enabling fast, confident delivery.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Measure outcomes rigorously and iterate: set success metrics, run post-launch assessments, and turn bespoke wins into adaptable workstreams.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:check: You have...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;6+ years of program or operations management experience leading complex, cross-functional initiatives end-to-end in product, platform, content, or operations domains.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A track record of designing and scaling systems or workflows that improved speed, quality, and efficiency across multiple teams or markets at the scale of millions of users.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Demonstrated ability to create clarity from ambiguity, drive alignment without authority, and make sound, ROI-focused decisions.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Strong operational rigor: you set clear goals, define SLAs/KPIs, manage risk and dependencies, and communicate crisply with executives and partners.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Technical fluency partnering with engineering to shape specs, roadmaps, and tooling for scale; comfortable with data to inform prioritization and tradeoffs.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Excellent written and verbal communication skills and experience working with stakeholders across Engineering, Learning &amp;amp; Curriculum, Product, and Finance.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The ability to work from or relocate to Pittsburgh, PA or New York City, NY.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:star: Exceptional candidates will have...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience rapidly scaling operations or content across many languages, markets, or products, with measurable improvements in time-to-launch, time-to-scale or quality.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Proven wins turning 0-to-1 programs into durable systems, including establishing evaluation loops, automation, or expert workflows.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience building decision frameworks that enabled shifts to new operating models or technologies (e.g., AI-assisted scaling) with clear cost/quality outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Background working at the intersection of engineering, content, and product, maturing systems for reliability and observability at scale.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We post a multi-level salary range for all of our roles.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is not inclusive of the rest of our awesome portfolio that includes equity compensation and world-class benefits.

    "description": "&lt;p&gt;Our mission at Duolingo is to develop the best education in the world and make it universally available. It’s a big mission, and that’s where you come in!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At Duolingo, you’ll join a team that cares about educating our users, experimenting with big ideas, making fact-based decisions, and finding innovative solutions to complex problems. You’ll have limitless learning opportunities and daily collaborations with world-class minds — while doing work that’s both meaningful and fun.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Join our life-changing mission to develop education for our half a billion (and growing!) learners around the world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Read &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.duolingo.com/?utm_source=greenhouse.com&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=generalblog_gh_091224&quot;&gt;our blog&lt;/a&gt; to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Duolingo is seeking a Staff Data Scientist to own and evolve our most critical financial forecasting systems. This is a high-stakes, high-visibility role at the center of our business strategy, where experimentation, subscription dynamics, and product development converge. You will work closely with Monetization product and engineering leadership, the finance team, and senior company executives to produce forecasts that are not only accurate but explainable, trusted, and decision-ready.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are looking for someone who deeply understands the statistical and strategic challenges of modeling constantly evolving consumer subscription products. You will need to separate signal from noise, lead investigations when reality diverges from prediction, clearly communicate the business and product impacts of modeling outcomes, and give senior leaders confidence in your numbers when the stakes are high.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:brain:&amp;nbsp; You will...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lead the financial forecasting system.&lt;/strong&gt; Drive methodology, implementation, maintenance, and delivery as the technical owner of our revenue forecasting stack, in close partnership with the finance team. Publish forecasts that serve as the source of truth for company-wide planning and investor-facing decisions.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Model subscription + experimentation dynamics. &lt;/strong&gt;Develop modeling architectures that account for experimental lift, cohort behavior, seasonality, and more, making it clear what’s real impact and what’s noise across the hundreds of experiments Duolingo runs each quarter.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investigate deviations and lead with insight. &lt;/strong&gt;When forecasts miss, lead the root-cause analysis by quantifying drivers of over- or under-performance (e.g. product changes, user behavior shifts, macro trends), collaborating across functions, and clearly communicating what happened and why to senior leadership. Build and be responsible for the statistics, tools, and dashboards that scale these insights across the company.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advance the technical frontier. &lt;/strong&gt;Push our evolution beyond traditional time-series extrapolation and toward more sophisticated approaches such as cohort-based forecasting, retention chaining, and/or causal impact modeling, grounded in business realism and model interpretability.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mentor and influence. &lt;/strong&gt;Serve as a technical mentor to data scientists across the organization, set a high standard for modeling, communication, and statistical rigor, and develop roadmaps for forecasting infrastructure and innovation.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:check:&amp;nbsp; You have...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forecasting domain expertise&lt;/strong&gt;. 6+ years of proven experience building production-grade forecasting systems, with deep applied knowledge of subscription models and understanding of churn dynamics, cohort behaviors, and retention curves.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advanced technical and statistical skills. &lt;/strong&gt;Advanced degree (Masters or PhD) in Data Science, Economics, Statistics, or a related quantitative field with experience assessing and applying theoretical approaches in real-world situations (ex. when to use Bayesian structural models, when causal inference is vital, when a robust heuristic is better than over-fitting noise, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Executive communication&lt;/strong&gt;. Experience distilling uncertainty, nuance, and model tradeoffs into streamlined, actionable narratives for finance and senior leadership partners. Ability to communicate complex forecasting logic clearly and stand by your work in moments of ambiguity.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collaborative style. &lt;/strong&gt;Track record of collaboration across technical and non-technical teams, with a consistent record of integrating feedback, aligning across functions, and operating with a strong sense of ownership and service.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Business responsiveness. &lt;/strong&gt;Strong judgment when balancing model complexity, interpretability, and speed of development, sometimes sacrificing exactness for interpretability. Adapt quickly to fast-paced product and business changes and make model tradeoffs accordingly.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Code quality and reproducibility.&lt;/strong&gt; Expertise writing clean, well-documented code in Python and SQL, and building reliable, multipurpose production pipelines.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experience in high-experimentation environments.&lt;/strong&gt; Past work in organizations where A/B testing is constant, complicating training data and historical baselines.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We post a multi-level salary range for all of our roles.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is not inclusive of the rest of our awesome portfolio that includes equity compensation and world-class benefits.
