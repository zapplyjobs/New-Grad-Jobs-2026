    "job_description": "Airtable is the no-code app platform that empowers people closest to the work to accelerate their most critical business processes. More than 500,000 organizations, including 80% of the Fortune 100, rely on Airtable to transform how work gets done.Airtable is looking for a Senior Manager, Enterprise Marketing Programs to build and own our enterprise pipeline marketing engine. This role owns the vision and execution of systemically converting in-market signals into qualified sales conversations through experimental and robust marketing programs. What you'll do In this role, you'll create qualified sales pipeline through two complementary approaches: (1) building broad demand generation programs using solutions messaging to attract enterprise buyers at scale through channels like webinars, paid media, email, and events, and (2) hunting and activating high-propensity accounts by identifying product usage signals that indicate upgrade readiness. You will identify and engage existing Airtable champions with targeted programs—whether with relevant solutions, or expansion/upsell messaging. You'll design and execute these programs, partnering with sales on outbound plays, competitive campaigns, and new motions. This role requires someone who can both architect the strategy, execute the programs, and measure what's working—you'll own building the enterprise pipeline marketing engine from the ground up. That means running multiple programs simultaneously, partnering across teams (PMM, sales, creative, digital, events), drafting your own messaging and content to test, designing experiments to learn what converts, and making real-time decisions about where to invest. Experimentation is how you’ll learn fast and discover what drives enterprise revenue at scale. Core Responsibilities Generate qualified enterprise pipeline through integrated marketing programs aligned to Airtable's priority GTM plays Accelerate time-to-conversation by optimizing engagement models, messaging, and channel strategies across email, paid, events, and social Draft messaging, content, and creative briefs to test what converts—partnering with PMM, creative, and agencies to scale what works Convert product signals into enterprise opportunities by identifying and activating accounts showing enterprise characteristics through solutions-led programming Build the repeatable pipeline engine - design, test, and scale programs that systematically turn GTM plays into revenue Drive marketing-sales alignment by representing Demand Gen in cross-functional GTM meetings, partnering on outbound programs, and building tight feedback loops that improve targeting and performance Who you are Experience: 8-10+ years in B2B enterprise marketing with deep expertise in integrated program design and execution Strong understanding of PLG -> enterprise motions and proven track record generating measurable pipeline and revenue Experience with sales plays and outbound marketing motions. ABM experience a nice to have. Background working closely with product marketing on GTM launches and optimizing funnel metrics Experience with Airtable or similar no-code AI platforms; genuine enthusiasm for building with and using AI in your work Solutions marketing, vertical marketing, or PLG-to-Enterprise experience highly valued How You Work: Extremely independent operator who thrives in ambiguity Bias to action: you ship fast, learn fast, and iterate Experimental mindset: design tests, kill what doesn't work, double down on what does Takes extreme ownership—you design it, build it, run it, measure it, improve it Strong cross-functional collaboration skills; ability to influence without authority What Makes This Role Unique This isn't about running the playbook—it's about writing it in real-time. Airtable's PLG model generates thousands of high-intent product signals daily, and your job is to design the programs that convert those signals into enterprise pipeline at scale. You'll need to figure out what works, often with incomplete information, and be willing to scrap what doesn't. We're looking for someone who doesn't just market the product—you use it. If you're energized by building in the unknown, measure success in pipeline generated (not just programs launched), and move fast—this role is for you. Airtable is an equal opportunity employer.

Our total compensation package for full-time employees includes equity and benefits.Annual Salary:$300,000 - $405,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.
