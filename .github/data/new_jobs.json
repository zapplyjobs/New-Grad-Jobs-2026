We're seeking a Brand Designer to join our team. As a Brand Designer at Supabase, you’ll play a crucial role in shaping our visual storytelling across a variety of mediums, including decks, printed materials, YouTube content, and conference assets. Working closely with Marketing, DevRel, Success and Enterprise teams, you’ll bring our ideas to life with compelling visuals that engage our developer community and amplify our brand at conferences, events, swag, and beyond. Your work will have a direct impact on how developers perceive and engage with Supabase, helping to create a cohesive and powerful brand presence across all touch points. You’ll push creative boundaries and set high standards for visual communication that resonates with our audience. You’ll have opportunities to lead, propose, and execute projects across various formats, from polished presentations to impactful print designs. Your contributions will help tell Supabase’s story in a way that is consistent and memorable. We Need: Design Expertise: Proficiency in design tools like Figma, Adobe Creative Suite (like InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop), and presentation tools (like Google Slides, Keynote, PowerPoint — maybe Figma Slides?).

Feature-Only Mindset: We prioritize cohesive storytelling and visual impact over isolated, unconnected designs. Low Initiative: We’re looking for proactive, resourceful designers who bring ideas to the table. “Re-do Everything” Approach: Focus on incremental improvements rather than overhauling everything at once. Inflexibility: This role requires adaptability to changing requirements and team dynamics. What We Offer Fully Remote We hire globally. We believe you can do your best work from anywhere.
