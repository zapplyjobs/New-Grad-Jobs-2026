    "job_description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems. About the role Join Anthropic's Languages Team as a Python foundational member shaping how Python is used across one of the world's fastest-growing AI companies. We're looking for a Python expert to help define and build the development ecosystem that powers the future of AI development. You'll be responsible for the full lifecycle of how Python is used by engineers and researchers across Anthropic—from research experiments to production systems serving millions. This includes building foundational language infrastructure, defining best practices, creating tooling, and ensuring exceptional developer productivity while supporting both cutting-edge AI research and massive-scale deployment. Working at the intersection of the Python ecosystem and AI development, you'll tackle uniquely complex problems where your architectural decisions directly impact how thousands of engineers develop AI systems safely and efficiently. The infrastructure you build must support diverse workloads—from experimental research code to battle-tested production systems—all while maintaining the highest standards of safety, performance, and developer experience. This is an opportunity to establish the standards and foundations for how Python enables AI development at unprecedented scale, working alongside some of the brightest minds in AI research and engineering. Responsibilities: Design and build foundational Python infrastructure that supports both AI research workflows and production-scale systems Define and implement Python ecosystem standards, best practices, tooling, libraries, and frameworks that ensure safety, performance, and exceptional developer productivity across diverse AI workloads Establish Python-specific CI/CD pipeline integration, testing frameworks, and deployment strategies optimized for AI development cycles Partner extensively with infrastructure teams to ensure seamless integration between Python tooling and broader platform services, such as debugging Kubernetes issues, optimizing node instance types for performance, and collaborating on cross-cutting infrastructure challenges Collaborate closely with research and engineering teams to understand emerging requirements and translate them into robust, scalable Python infrastructure, including cross-language interoperability solutions (particularly with Rust) Drive technical strategy for Python ecosystem evolution as Anthropic scales, while mentoring engineers and researchers on Python best practices Lead incident response and troubleshooting for Python-related issues across research and production environments You may be a good fit if you: Have 5+ years of production software engineering experience with deep expertise in Python Have strong experience in developer tooling, build systems, dependency management within a monorepo environment Are comfortable working across the stack, including debugging infrastructure issues like Kubernetes problems or optimizing system performance Have strong communication and collaboration skills to work effectively with diverse teams including researchers, engineers, and infrastructure specialists Are excited about defining foundational systems and processes and are comfortable working independently on ambiguous, high-impact technical challenges Strong candidates may have: Rust experience—we use Rust alongside Python, and familiarity with Python-Rust interop (e.g., PyO3, maturin) is a significant plus Built core Python infrastructure like interpreters, package ecosystems, typing tools, or maintained widely-used open-source Python developer tools with significant adoption Expertise in Python performance optimization, including experience with Cython, profiling tools, or optimizing Python runtimes Experience with AI/ML research-to-production workflows, understanding the unique challenges of supporting both experimental research code and production model training/serving pipelines Deadline to apply: None. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis. The expected base compensation for this position is below. Our total compensation package for full-time employees includes equity, benefits, and may include incentive compensation.Annual Salary:$320,000 - $485,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

    "job_description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the Role As Technical Policy Lead for Government and Third-Party Safety Partnerships, you'll advance Anthropic's safety partnerships with governments and the broader third-party ecosystem. This is a hybrid role that is technically grounded but drives policy impact – strengthening state capacity, building a wider ecosystem for AI safety, and developing shared standards, in order to advance Anthropic’s mission to ensure the world safely makes the transition through transformative AI. You'll serve as the critical bridge between Anthropic's Policy, Frontier Red Team, Alignment, Safeguards, and Legal teams on one side, and government safety institutes and third-party evaluators on the other. You'll manage complex multi-stakeholder engagements spanning pre-deployment evaluations, collaborative safety research, information-sharing agreements, and regulatory harmonization efforts. As AI capabilities advance, these partnerships will be essential for providing trusted external validation of our safety efforts. Working within our International Policy team, you'll have significant autonomy to shape these partnerships. We're looking for someone who can be both a trusted partner to external counterparts and a thoughtful steward of Anthropic's resources and priorities - someone who brings clear judgment about where to focus our efforts for maximum impact. This role exists to ensure our government and third-party safety partnerships are strategically coherent, technically sound, and structured in ways that scale globally. In this role you will: Identify collaboration opportunities that advance state capacity on AI safety, strengthen the broader safety ecosystem, and support Anthropic policy objectives for ASL-4+ readiness and standards harmonization Develop frameworks for engaging with emerging government safety organizations, to promoting a coherent global approach that leverages each country's unique capabilities Evaluate and prioritize inbound requests from external safety organizations, ensuring Anthropic's engagement is focused on high-impact collaborations Own strategic alignment as well as day-to-day coordination with US CAISI, UK AISI, and other safety organizations relevant to policy, serving as the primary operational point of contact Manage research and testing collaborations covering pre/post-deployment evaluations, safeguards testing, and alignment research Coordinate between internal teams, in particular Policy, Frontier Red Team, Alignment, Safeguards, Legal, and Communications to facilitate external safety partnerships Support Legal in negotiating and maintaining collaboration agreements and MOUs Manage technical access provisions in accordance with agreement terms Track external safety partnerships and provide timely updates to internal stakeholders Position external safety partnerships to provide decision-relevant information for internal safety teams and processes, such as in safety cases, and enable trusted independent evaluation and validation of our models and processes Represent Anthropic at external conferences and speaking engagements You may be a good fit if you: Have direct experience with government or third-party safety organizations. You may have previously worked with or at US CAISI, UK AISI, METR, Apollo, or equivalent organizations in research, technical program management, or operations roles. You understand how these organizations operate from the inside. Have a technical background in AI safety-relevant areas. You should have sufficient technical experience to engage credibly with evaluation methodologies, understand alignment and safeguards concepts, and partner with internal technical staff to solve problems. You should also have familiarity with safety standards such as our Responsible Scaling policy and the EU Code of Practice. Excel at multi-stakeholder coordination. You should have a proven track record managing complex programs that span research, policy, legal, and communications teams with differing priorities. Are comfortable making judgment calls in ambiguous situations. You can synthesize incomplete information from multiple teams, identify blockers, and drive decisions when strategic direction is evolving. Exercise sound judgment on prioritization. You can focus effort where it matters most and manage stakeholder expectations effectively, with clarity and directness. Communicate effectively across contexts. You are equally comfortable briefing executives on partnership strategy, explaining technical evaluation plans to policy teams, and managing day-to-day coordination with external researchers and engineers. Understand government contexts. You are familiar with how government agencies operate, including considerations around information security, inter-agency coordination, and policy development processes. This role can be based in San Francisco, Washington DC, or London. We are accepting applications through 5pm PT on January 5th, 2026The expected base compensation for this position is below. Our total compensation package for full-time employees includes equity, benefits, and may include incentive compensation.Annual Salary:$230,000 - $265,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.
