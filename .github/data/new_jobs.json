How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work.

We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses.

At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco.

Investigate, reproduce, and diagnose production problems across backend, frontend, and data-processing components. Develop operational runbooks, troubleshooting guides, and small automation scripts to streamline future support. Improve reliability through better observability, logging, alerting, and diagnostics. Support on-call rotations for critical operations. Over time, the expectation is that engineers use recurring support issues as input to improve system design, tooling, and reliability. Deployment and Reliability Deploy mission systems and updates using existing CI/CD pipelines. Monitor application performance and health to ensure system reliability. Troubleshoot issues in containerized environments to identify if bugs are code-related or config-related. Collaborate with other developers through code reviews, design sessions, and shared ownership of services. You will become comfortable making changes to production systems and standing behind those changes What You’ll Work on in Your First 12 Months As part of a small, highly collaborative software team, you will: Space Operations: Work daily with the Mission Operations Center, gaining a deep understanding of spacecraft and communication network operations Take Ownership: Become the primary developer supporting specific mission operations tools. Solve Problems: Handle L2 support escalations, delivering timely fixes that keep the satellites talking. Build Features: Contribute to the next generation of telemetry review and anomaly-analysis tools. Learn &amp; Grow: Stand up or refactor backend services to support new mission needs (new satellite configurations). Qualifications: 0–6 years of professional software development experience Experience building or maintaining backend services (Python, Java, Go, C#, or similar) Working knowledge of modern web development fundamentals (APIs, basic frontend, databases) Practical experience building UIs using React, Svelte, Vue, or Angular (TypeScript preferred) Familiarity with Git-based workflows and code reviews Ability to debug, test, and reason about existing codebases (checking logs, reproducing bugs, isolating errors) Willingness to work on-site and collaborate closely with operations teams Curiosity, ownership mindset, and desire to grow as an engineer Preferred Qualifications: Experience or interest in Rust programming Exposure to production systems, monitoring, or incident response Experience working with cloud environments (AWS preferred) Familiarity with testing, CI pipelines, or deployment workflows Interest in reliability, scalability, and systems thinking Experience working with time-series data, telemetry, or event-driven architectures.
