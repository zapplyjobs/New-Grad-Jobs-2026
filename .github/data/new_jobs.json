    "description": "&lt;p&gt;Customers depend on Datadog’s Incident Management product in crisis moments — when outages threaten their business — and your work will shape how teams respond and learn.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a Product Manager II, you’ll own the product that turns chaos into calm: declaring incidents, rallying responders, coordinating remediation, and turning every outage into a learning opportunity that prevents the next one. This is a broad, technically rich product — you’ll own features across real-time UIs, automation, AI-powered summaries and recommendations, documentation and runbooks, task and incident state management, analytics, and deep integrations with third-party chat and video platforms.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You’ll own the features that reduce Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR) for some of the world’s most complex cloud systems, partnering closely with the rest of the product organization to deliver end-to-end incident response. Your work will be highly visible to customers and internal stakeholders and will shape how organizations run reliable services at scale.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Datadog is uniquely positioned to deliver best-in-class end-to-end incident response by surfacing the right telemetry (metrics, traces, logs), orchestrating responders through alerting and paging, and closing the loop with automation and incident management.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;At Datadog, we place value in our office culture - the relationships and collaboration it builds and the creativity it brings to the table.

And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.
