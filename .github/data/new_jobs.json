We make this a reality by empowering you with the tools, resources, and support you need to grow your career.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sales at Brex&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Sales is the growth engine at Brex. We bring in new customers, expand existing relationships, and drive the company’s bottom line. With unlimited territories and uncapped opportunity, your ambition sets the ceiling.
