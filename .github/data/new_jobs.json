    "job_description": "Transforming the lives of those affected by severe mental illness At Amae Health, we are dedicated to helping the 15.4 million Americans living with severe mental illness (SMI) lead stable, meaningful lives, while ending the cycle of repeat hospitalizations. In partnership with some of the nation’s top academic medical centers we’ve pioneered an innovative outpatient care model that combines compassionate, in-person psychiatric care with comprehensive wraparound support. Our integrated care teams — including psychiatrists, therapists, primary care physicians, health coaches, and peer support specialists — work together to treat the whole person via a unique model, addressing physical, mental, and social needs in unison. By caring for every aspect of our patients’ well-being, we help them not just survive, but truly thrive. Amae Health is a Series B venture-backed Public Benefit Corporation dedicated to becoming the nation's center of excellence for individuals living with severe mental illness (SMI). Backed by top-tier venture capital firms and strategic healthcare investors, we collaborate with prestigious health systems including NewYork-Presbyterian and Cedars-Sinai, underscoring our commitment to fundamentally transforming mental health care delivery at scale. The Team: At Amae we are a collective of healthcare leaders and technologists on a mission to create a radically different patient-first behavioral health care model that truly transforms patient’s lives by integrating care delivery, patient experience, cutting edge technology and research. Join a team of operators, builders and technologists from One Medical, Forward Health, Stanford, UCLA, Hinge Health, Palantir, The Four Seasons, and Brightline as we redefine care for the most vulnerable populations - across the nation, at scale. The Opportunity: As we expand our ability to care for complex patient populations, the core teams that support this work are also growing! We are seeking an Associate Software Engineer to help build and scale Amae Health’s patient and clinic facing technology platform. Central to shaping how patients and families access our precision psychiatry services, this role is fundamental to ensuring our solutions are both technically robust and adaptable to the evolving needs of care.

About You: You’re a full-stack engineer who thrives at the intersection of traditional engineering best practices and the emerging AI-native development paradigm. You’re fluent in writing and reviewing production-grade code, but you also bring discernment and pragmatism in how to integrate AI-generated code into a secure, reliable product. You’re equally comfortable architecting backend systems as you are collaborating on frontend experiences. You take pride in mentoring peers, raising engineering standards, and ensuring code quality across the stack. You’re energized by the fast pace of early-stage work and motivated to build systems that directly improve mental health outcomes for patients and families. What you’ll work on: Full-Stack Development Lead design, implementation, and review of features across the stack, with emphasis on scalable, secure, and maintainable architecture. Build backend services, APIs, and frontend interfaces that power the patient experience. Contribute to both backend and frontend, with flexibility to lean where your strengths are deepest. AI-Native Engineering (Software 3.0) Leverage LLMs and AI-native tooling to accelerate development while maintaining rigorous standards. Apply strong code review practices to both human- and AI-generated contributions, ensuring correctness, security, and long-term maintainability. Help define best practices for AI-augmented workflows in production-grade healthcare software. Collaboration Partner with product, design, and clinical teams to translate mental healthcare needs into intuitive software. Participate in architectural discussions and guide the evolution of our platform. What you’ll have: 1+ years of professional software engineering experience, with proven full-stack contributions Strong fundamentals in modern backend (Node.js, Python, or similar) and frontend frameworks, with Next.js experience preferred Deep familiarity with cloud-native environments (AWS & Vercel) Pragmatic approach to code review: able to spot issues in both human- and AI-generated code, and guide teams toward best practices Excitement about “software development 3.0”—working AI-native, but with the maturity to know when traditional approaches are required Collaborative, mission-driven mindset, motivated to improve mental health outcomes at scale This is a full-time in person role based in our San Francisco or Manhattan offices What we provide: Health Insurance: Comprehensive medical, dental & vision plans Competitive compensation Employee Assistance Program 401(k) FSA & HSA savings programs Short & long-term disability Pre-tax commuter assistance program Unlimited paid time off (PTO) Parental Leave - 12 weeks for birth and non birth parent 11 company holidays Amae Health is committed to fair and equitable compensation practices. Base salary range for this role is $115,000 to $155,000 per year based on a full-time schedule and the compensation package will include equity. Actual compensation packages are based on several factors that are unique to each candidate's experience and professional leveling and it is not typical for an individual to be hired at or near the top of the range. These factors include, but are not limited to, job related knowledge and skill set, depth of experience, certifications, degrees, licensures, and specific work location.More About Amae: 'Amae', pronounced ‘Ah-mai’, is a Japanese concept meaning the need to be in good favor with, and the ability to depend on, the people around oneself. It reflects our core belief that a strong support system is essential to build people up, strengthen their will to carry on and even to thrive in life. This mentality applies across our whole company – from the patients we serve to the team we’re building. We’re a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC) that provides outpatient psychiatric and primary care health services through value-based care arrangements. Our model’s success is predicated upon achieving outcomes for our patients, not on the volume of services provided. Amae Health is an equal opportunity employer and encourages all applicants from every background and life experience to apply.",
