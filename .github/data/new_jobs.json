    "job_description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the role UX research at Anthropic is a small team with outsized leverage. We work across products used by millions of people—and on interactions that don't have established conventions yet. We inform critical decisions through rigorous research, with stakeholders who eagerly incorporate findings into their work. Research has a seat at the table for product strategy, and we partner closely with design, product, and engineering. We combine qualitative and quantitative methods to understand user needs in a space that's evolving faster than anyone can track. We move fast, favor impact over polish, and increasingly build our own tools to do research at the speed this environment demands. Responsibilities: Identify the highest-leverage research questions and pursue them with urgency Design and execute qualitative and quantitative studies Get hands-on with product data to answer questions quickly Synthesize findings into clear recommendations that drive cross-functional decisions Partner closely with PMs, designers, and engineers to shape product direction Communicate insights through compelling storytelling, tailored to your audience Specific projects depend on team staffing—we'll figure that out together once we understand your strengths and interests. A few examples: Enterprise: What makes employees love Claude enough to champion it internally? How do we help organizations transform how they work—and measure the ROI? Claude Cowork: What ways of working with Claude are genuinely transformative? What would help more people get value from it? Claude Code: How will coding work continue to evolve? How do we deliver seamless experiences across surfaces and keep developers (and non-devs) deeply satisfied? What we're looking for: You surface what teams aren’t seeing. You take initiative, identify blind spots, and push stakeholders to ask harder questions—not just answer the ones they bring you. You move fast. You'd rather run a scrappy study today than a perfect one next week. You bring rigor without rigidity. You've executed enough good research that strong methods come naturally—freeing you to adapt and get creative as needed. You're an AI-native user researcher. You already use AI tools to improve your workflows and you're excited to help us create the research tools of the future. You stay close to the product. You pay attention to where capabilities are heading and help us find and then ride that next opportunity. You're technical and self-sufficient. You’re experienced working directly with product analytics and behavioral data. You make stakeholders more user-centered. You partner closely with PMs, designers, and engineers, and help them internalize user thinking so it spreads beyond your research. You may be a good fit if you have: 5+ years of industry UX research experience Strong track record of driving product decisions through research Expertise with mixed methods (both qualitative and quantitative) Strong SQL skills; able to self-serve on data—pulling samples, analyzing usage patterns, working in product analytics tools Ability to adapt and thrive in ambiguous, fast-moving environments Excellent storytelling Strong product intuition with ability to generate strong opportunities and strategies Strong candidates may also: Have a master's or PhD in HCI, Cognitive Psychology, Anthropology, Information Science, or related field Have built research tools or conducted novel methods using AI The annual compensation range for this role is listed below. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.Annual Salary:$260,000 - $305,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.
