How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

Founded in 2016, Verkada has expanded rapidly with 15 offices and 2,200+ full-time employees.The Mission Verkada is dedicated to leading the physical security world into the future with a customer-centric approach and takes pride in its excellent documentation, support, and sales engineering teams. But sometimes things go wrong. The Critical Accounts Program (CAP) is our \"last line of defense\" when we are at risk of losing a relationship. As a CAP Engineer, you don’t just manage cases; you drop into and access high-stakes situations, marshall the resources needed to stabilize the client, and ensure they are happy before moving to the next mission. Imagine a major hospital system goes live with Verkada, but a network configuration issue prevents their cameras from recording during a critical event. While others might see a ticket, a Critical Accounts Engineer sees a partnership in jeopardy. You are the one who gets the call, jumps on a plane that evening, and walks into their command center the next morning to lead our engineers and their IT staff toward a solution. How You’ll Serve Our Customers Rapid Incident Command: Take end-to-end ownership of escalated customer cases, driving swift, high-impact solutions to restore confidence. Executive Advocacy: Serve as the single point of contact for customer executives, providing transparent diagnosis and expedited problem resolution. On-Site Deployment: Be ready to travel at a moment’s notice to meet with customers face-to-face or perform in-depth on-site troubleshooting. Strategic Alignment: Coordinate across Engineering, Product, Sales, and Support to prioritize the fixes our customers need most. Insights for Growth: Translate customer pain points into actionable insights that influence the long-term product roadmap and strengthen long-term partnerships. Who You Are Technical: You know “a lot about something.” We don’t expect you to know networking or physical security in depth before starting, but whatever technology you worked with in the past, you know to a deep level. For example, if you were in wide area networking, you know the nuance of how BGP and DNS work. Or if you worked in storage, you know a lot about file systems. Proven Problem Solver: You have 3–6+ years of experience getting things done. We’re less concerned about what, exactly, so much as that you have had a real impact. Calm Under Pressure: You have a demonstrated ability to manage high-level customers and mission-critical situations with composure. Detail-Oriented: You are highly organized and capable of managing multiple complex escalations simultaneously. Why Join the CAP Team? Joining the CAP team offers a unique impact where, in an established company of over 2,500 people growing very quickly, you will be \"one of one\", a specialist with a role unlike any other in the organization. You are joining a new team that has already seen significant success over the past year and is now expanding to meet the needs of our global customer base. In this role, you will develop senior-level decision-making and communication skills while working directly with Verkada’s top decision-makers. Ultimately, you will shine a light on the issues that matter most to ensure no customer is left behind, strengthening Verkada's most critical relationships. Additional Information You must be independently authorized to work in the U.S. We are unable to sponsor or take over sponsorship of an employment visa for this role, at this time.Annual Pay Range At Verkada, we want to attract and retain the best employees, and compensate them in a way that appropriately and fairly values their individual contribution to the company.

You are the one who gets the call, jumps on a plane that evening, and walks into their command center the next morning to lead our engineers and their IT staff toward a solution.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How You’ll Serve Our Customers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rapid Incident Command:&lt;/strong&gt; Take end-to-end ownership of escalated customer cases, driving swift, high-impact solutions to restore confidence.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Executive Advocacy:&lt;/strong&gt; Serve as the single point of contact for customer executives, providing transparent diagnosis and expedited problem resolution.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On-Site Deployment: &lt;/strong&gt;Be ready to travel at a moment’s notice to meet with customers face-to-face or perform in-depth on-site troubleshooting.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategic Alignment:&lt;/strong&gt; Coordinate across Engineering, Product, Sales, and Support to prioritize the fixes our customers need most.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insights for Growth:&lt;/strong&gt; Translate customer pain points into actionable insights that influence the long-term product roadmap and strengthen long-term partnerships.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who You Are&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical:&lt;/strong&gt; You know “a lot about something.”&amp;nbsp; We don’t expect you to know networking or physical security in depth before starting, but whatever technology you worked with in the past, you know to a deep level.&amp;nbsp; For example, if you were in wide area networking, you know the nuance of how BGP and DNS work.&amp;nbsp; Or if you worked in storage, you know a lot about file systems.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proven Problem Solver:&lt;/strong&gt; You have 3–6+ years of experience getting things done.&amp;nbsp; We’re less concerned about what, exactly, so much as that you have had a real impact.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calm Under Pressure:&lt;/strong&gt; You have a demonstrated ability to manage high-level customers and mission-critical situations with composure.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Detail-Oriented:&lt;/strong&gt; You are highly organized and capable of managing multiple complex escalations simultaneously.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Join the CAP Team?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Joining the CAP team offers a unique impact where, in an established company of over 2,500 people growing very quickly, you will be &quot;&lt;strong&gt;one of one&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;, a specialist with a role unlike any other in the organization.
