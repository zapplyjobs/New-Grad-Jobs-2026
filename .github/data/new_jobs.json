    "job_title": "Data Operations Associate",
    "employer_name": "Arch",
    "job_city": "NYC",
    "job_state": "Locations",
    "job_description": "Our Company Arch is a Series B financial technology company that automates the management of private investments, improving access, understanding, and the human experience of investing across asset classes. Private investments such as venture capital, hedge funds, and private equity, make up roughly 25% of the investment universe. Traditionally, investors, advisors, banks, families, and managers track hundreds of investments in complicated spreadsheets, file folders, and busy inboxes. Not only is this tedious and time-consuming, but it is rife with opportunity for manual data entry errors, inconsistent reporting, and lost information. Enter, Arch. Arch delivers standardized data, documents, and insights in a single platform, avoiding the need to chase information across dozens or hundreds of ‘portals’. Our purpose is to save investors’ time while empowering them to make more informed investment decisions, leading to better financial outcomes. We are a fast-growing, dynamic team of 200+, serving over 400 clients, including several of America’s largest banks, families, and financial institutions. We’ve over doubled the size of the company every year since inception and we are looking to hire in all departments as we scale. About the Role: We’re looking for a Data Operations Associate to help keep the engine of Arch running smoothly. Private investment data can be complex and messy - your job will be to help clean it up, spot issues before they become problems, and make sure our clients always have the most accurate information at their fingertips. You’ll work across teams, dig into details, and use your curiosity to turn raw data into something reliable and usable. What You’ll Do: Use automated tools to monitor data and flag potential issues. Investigate problems, partner with teammates across Operations and Engineering, and help fix root causes. Review new data sets with a critical eye - spotting discrepancies, reconciling accounts, and making sure everything adds up. Keep records of what you find and how you fix it, so we can continuously improve our systems. Share your findings with the team and highlight opportunities to make our platform even better. Collaborate with onboarding, support, operations, and engineering teams to make sure client data is complete and accurate from the start. What We’re Looking For: Recent Graduate (within 12 months) or Graduating in Winter 2025 or Spring 2026 with a degree in Data Science, Computer Science, Information Systems, Business Analytics, or a related field. Have experience with data analysis through coursework, internships, or projects (bonus if you’ve worked with financial or investment data). Experience using SQL, Python, or data visualization tools. Enjoy solving puzzles, spotting patterns, and catching the details others might miss. Can explain technical findings clearly to teammates who don’t live in data all day. Take pride in finishing what you start and making sure it’s polished and accurate. Want a first job that blends tech, problem-solving, and mentorship. Bring creativity to your work (and know how to have fun while doing it). Bonus points if you: Are familiar with the alternative investment industry and the mechanics of investing in private equity, hedge funds, and private companies. Have a background in private banking, investment management, or a related field. Have taken finance or accounting courses. A Note about us: All of our full-time roles are based onsite at our New York City office , where our team thrives on in-person collaboration and dynamic teamwork. Being onsite daily enables us to build strong connections, collaborate effectively to solve challenges, and foster an engaging environment focused on shipping product and delivering exceptional service to our clients. We encourage applicants currently located in or willing to relocate to the NYC area to join us in this exciting, hands-on workspace. Some perks of working for Arch include: Strong Team - You’ll be backed by a strong team that consistently exceeds client expectations and ships new products quickly. Your work is high impact - Being part of a small team means you have real responsibility and impact from day one. You'll be involved in discussions that drive the growth and direction of our platform from the very beginning. Product Market Fit - We have strong product market fit, exceptionally low churn, and have grown mostly organically through word of mouth. Team community and camaraderie - We have enormous trust in each other and always do what we can do to support one another. We're always ready to step in to help. Great office - we’ve invested in a great space for the Arch team to come together, at 18th and Park in Manhattan (the old Buzzfeed / NYT headquarters). Lunch is on Us - Grab lunch on us while you’re in the office and take a break to laugh, brainstorm, or just hang out with your teammates over a meal.",
