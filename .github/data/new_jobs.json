    "job_description": "About Clerk Clerk is on a mission to solve user management once and for all. We are a globally distributed team dedicated to providing best-in-class developer experience, with obsessive attention to every detail. Today, we provide developers with full-stack React components and hooks like &lt;SignUp/&gt; , &lt;SignIn/&gt; , &lt;UserProfile/&gt; , useUser , and useOrganization . These APIs allow developers to build hard-to-get-right user and organization management flows. We believe that a component is worth a thousand APIs . About the Role Clerk is looking for engineering-minded Product Manager to help us bring new functionality to the Clerk platform, specifically our Billing product. This role will have you work on nimble teams and connect directly with customers to define and execute functionality that developers love and support builders launching and growing their businesses. What You'll Do We’re a small but growing team with big ambitions. This means you’ll have responsibility far beyond closing out pre-sliced tickets. We’re looking for people that are comfortable working across the stack to solve product problems for real users. We will expect you to: Collaborate with customers and teammates - be part of a world-class product delivery team that cares deeply about customer needs and the value of constant iteration. We’re fully remote, which means you’ll need to practice good communication habits to keep things moving. Execute - Clerk values product people who execute. That means approaching all of your work iteratively and reducing the time between feedback cycles. Thrive in a dynamic environment - Clerk is not well suited for product people who expect every task to be a series of predefined steps. We believe the best approach is to -work- through our customer’s problems in the trenches and not merely -think- through them from the sidelines. Be Customer 0 - Clerk is built on top of Clerk. That means the work you do to solve our internal projects likely will also become functionality that we release to customers as well. This is one of the most unique and exciting parts of Clerk. Be technical - Clerk is a collection of engineers doing engineering work, so that other engineers can do engineering work! Every staff member is expected to be as technical as the customers they are serving Embrace a culture of craft by focusing on engineering quality. We want our product to be best-in-class, and so we need our team to write maintainable, performant, and well-structured code. Who You Are You have experience making product decisions and driving a team forward, whether as an Engineer in the past or as a Product Designer. You have experience with SaaS product monetization and pricing as a builder of a subscription product . You understand the technical landscape of developer tools. We may not ask you to write production-grade code but you should be able to implement Clerk as a customer and empathize deeply with people building SaaS products, particularly front-end and the JS/TS market. You’re a talented communicator and writer who understands the value of explaining complex topics simply. You’ve had previous experiences that required you to fill gaps on a team. Sometimes that means being an ex-founder or being a driving force on a team that needed leadership. You’re customer obsessed. You don’t overvalue your own ideas if they don’t match what is going to make your customer’s lives easier. You believe in solving real customer problems, even if it means making tradeoffs behind the scenes. You’re passionate about building for other engineers and obsess over making their experience better. You care about craft in all it’s forms, such as product constraints, design polish, and engineering execution. You love working on products you use yourself — because you know that’s how magic happens. Ideally, you're based in the US timezones or open to working US hours. Benefits Competitive Salary – We want you to know that we value the skills and experience you bring to the table. We go out of our way to make sure that you feel fairly compensated. Equity Ownership – At Clerk, we believe in shared success. That's why we offer a stock option plan so that everyone can benefit from the growth and prosperity of the company. Work Gear - Set up your ideal home office with the gear of your choice. At Clerk, we want to ensure that you have everything you need to perform at your best. Flexible Vacation Policy – We believe in work-life balance and trust you to take the time you need. Although we recommend 25 days per year, our vacation policy is unlimited. This is in addition to observing national holidays specific to your country of residence. Diverse and Inclusive Team – Join our exceptional, diverse, and globally distributed team at Clerk. We are committed to fostering an inclusive environment where everyone can contribute their best in building impactful products and tools for the modern web.",
