    "job_description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.Anthropic’s Audio team pushes the boundaries of what's possible with audio with large language models. We care about making safe, steerable, reliable systems that can understand and generate speech and audio, prioritizing not only naturalness but also steerability and robustness. As a researcher on the Audio team, you'll work across the full stack of audio ML, developing audio codecs and representations, sourcing and synthesizing high quality audio data, training large-scale speech language models and large audio diffusion models, and developing novel architectures for incorporating continuous signals into LLMs. Our team focuses primarily but not exclusively on speech, building advanced steerable systems spanning end-to-end conversational systems, speech and audio understanding models, and speech synthesis capabilities. The team works closely with many collaborators across pretraining, finetuning, reinforcement learning, production inference, and product to get advanced audio technologies from early research to high impact real-world deployments. You may be a good fit if you: Have hands-on experience with training audio models, whether that's conversational speech-to-speech, speech translation, speech recognition, text-to-speech, diarization, codecs, or generative audio models Genuinely enjoy both research and engineering work, and you'd describe your ideal split as roughly 50/50 rather than heavily weighted toward one or the other Are comfortable working across abstraction levels, from signal processing fundamentals to large-scale model training and inference optimization Have deep expertise with JAX, PyTorch, or large-scale distributed training, and can debug performance issues across the full stack Thrive in fast-moving environments where the most important problem might shift as we learn more about what works Communicate clearly and collaborate effectively; audio touches many parts of our systems, so you'll work closely with teams across the company Are passionate about building conversational AI that feels natural, steerable, and safe Care about the societal impacts of voice AI and want to help shape how these systems are developed responsibly Strong candidates may also have experience with: Large language model pretraining and finetuning Training diffusion models for image and audio generation Reinforcement learning for large language models and diffusion models End-to-end system optimization, from performance benchmarking to kernel optimization GPUs, Kubernetes, PyTorch, or distributed training infrastructure Representative projects: Training state-of-the art neural audio codecs for 48 kHz stereo audio Developing novel algorithms for diffusion pretraining and reinforcement learning Scaling audio datasets to millions of hours of high quality audio Creating robust evaluation methodologies for hard-to-measure qualities such as naturalness or expressiveness Studying training dynamics of mixed audio-text language models Optimizing latency and inference throughput for deployed streaming audio systems The annual compensation range for this role is listed below. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.Annual Salary:$350,000 - $500,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

We handle the hard stuff—like payroll, health insurance, 401(k)s, and HR—so owners can focus on their craft and customers. With teams in Denver, San Francisco, and New York, we’re proud to support more than 400,000 small businesses across the country, and we’re building a workplace that represents and celebrates the customers we serve. Learn more about our Total Rewards philosophy. About the Role: We're hiring a Staff-level engineer to join our Integrated Benefits team that works on improving our existing systems for extensibility and scalability, and building the future of Gusto's Benefits ecosystem. As a Staff Software Engineer, you'll lead complex technical projects end-to-end by contributing to feature specs, designing solutions that move existing systems toward desired end states, executing on projects, and maintaining code that powers core experiences for the Integrated Benefits team. The Integrated Benefits team focuses on the integration of users' existing benefits providers and the development of Voluntary Life and Disability (vLiDi) products. In this role, you will operate as a Builder, focusing on the architecture of complex and interconnected technical systems. You will have a scaled impact across the wider Benefits engineering organization by augmenting our Product Engineering culture with reusable capabilities and solid technical foundations. We are looking for engineers who are ready to solve deep, ambiguous architectural puzzles and apply AI tools to accelerate development and deliver new product capabilities. If you’re interested in building elegant software with far-reaching effects in our modern economy, join us! About the Team: The Integrated Benefits (IB) team operates with a heart for complex challenge within the larger Gusto Benefits organization, serving as the critical link for users' existing benefits providers and the development of Voluntary Life and Disability (vLiDi) products. Our work enables customers to work with an external broker while still leveraging Gusto’s people platform to seamlessly integrate and manage their benefits. We offer the unique opportunity to solve deep, ambiguous architectural puzzles and integrate our systems with the org-wide push for AI. This high-performing, independent group values humor and casual connection, fostering an environment that enjoys pairing and problem-solving together. Here’s what you’ll do day-to-day: Serve as a technical leader within the Integrated Benefits team, mentoring engineers on your team and contributing technical expertise to cross-team initiatives within the Benefits organization. Design, build, and test the solid technical foundations and reusable \"LEGO blocks\" that support our Voluntary Life and Disability (vLiDi) products and broker integrations. Help scale our platform by architecting complex, interconnected technical systems and executing within a Ruby on Rails environment. Collaborate on complex and ambiguous problems, partnering with cross-functional teams to solve deep architectural puzzles and take existing systems closer to desired end states. Mentor and grow fellow engineers, fostering a culture of ownership and mentorship within a high-performing, self-organized team. Drive the product development process for platform capabilities, from influencing initial feature specs to maintaining code that powers core experiences. Improve the productivity of our product engineering culture by building tools and shared capabilities that allow teams to move faster. Continuously apply AI tools to accelerate development, using AI to build, test, and iterate quickly while staying curious about emerging frameworks and patterns. Here’s what we're looking for: 10+ years of professional software engineering experience with demonstrated technical leadership on complex platform or product engineering projects. Able to build maintainable, structured, well-documented code, with specific proficiency in Ruby on Rails and a strong focus on architectural patterns. Strong knowledge of data structures, data modeling, and system design, particularly within complex, interconnected systems. Experience working across multiple teams, influencing both product and team direction by advocating for technical health and reusability. Experience working on platform products which are depended upon throughout the company, ideally involving service extraction or componentization. Experience engineering, designing, building, and supporting large-scale systems in production, ensuring high reliability and scalability.

Our customers come from all walks of life and so do we. We hire great people from a wide variety of backgrounds, not just because it's the right thing to do, but because it makes our company stronger.

    "job_description": "About Gusto At Gusto, we're on a mission to grow the small business economy. We handle the hard stuff—like payroll, health insurance, 401(k)s, and HR—so owners can focus on their craft and customers. With teams in Denver, San Francisco, and New York, we’re proud to support more than 400,000 small businesses across the country, and we’re building a workplace that represents and celebrates the customers we serve. Learn more about our Total Rewards philosophy. About the Role: You’ll be a key engineer helping us ship real, user-facing AI at Gusto Retirement. This role is all about bias to action: owning problems end-to-end, getting working software in front of customers, and iterating quickly. You’ll work closely with a small, senior team to implement language-model-powered experiences. If you like being hands-on, making pragmatic technical decisions, working closely with product & design partners, and turning ideas into production features, you’ll be a great fit. About the Team: We’re a small, focused AI product team building practical, high-impact experiences to help people save for retirement at Gusto Retirement. The team is senior, collaborative, and very execution-focused—PMs bring strong ideas, and we own the execution fully. We work closely with product, design, and partner engineering teams, but keep tight ownership of our priorities and roadmap. Here’s what you’ll do day-to-day: Design, build, and ship production features that use large language models to solve real customer problems. Implement and integrate LLMs (prompting, tool loops, evaluation, monitoring, etc). Make pragmatic architecture decisions, de-risk tricky areas, and keep the work unblocked. Partner with product and design to refine ideas, shape scope, and iterate quickly on end-to-end experiences. Collaborate with other engineering teams to integrate with existing systems and unblock dependencies. Write clear, reliable, well-tested code that ships quickly and scales well. Here’s what we're looking for: 10+ years of software engineering experience building and shipping production products or platforms Hands-on experience implementing LLM-powered features (e.g., RAG flows, agents, tool loops, workflow automation with language models, etc) Strong engineering skills (e.g., services, APIs, data flows); comfortable spending most of your time coding. Experience running or heavily contributing to a team’s execution: sprints, Jira, scoping, and cross-functional coordination. Bias to action: you default to trying things, iterating, and learning, rather than getting stuck in analysis or waiting for direction. Clear communicator who can work well with product, design, and other engineering teams without needing a formal management title. Experienced with Ruby on Rails (or any comparable language), React (or any comparable library). Please note that travel to Gusto’s Denver office for onboarding is required for this position. If you have any questions regarding this requirement, please share with your recruiter. Our cash compensation amount for this role is targeted at $213,000/yr to $236,000/yr in Denver & most remote locations, and $251,000/yr to $278,000/yr for San Francisco, Seattle & New York. Stock equity is additional. Final offer amounts are determined by multiple factors including candidate experience and expertise and may vary from the amounts listed above. Gusto has physical office spaces in Denver, San Francisco, and New York City. Employees who are based in those locations will be expected to work from the office on designated days approximately 2-3 days per week (or more depending on role). The same office expectations apply to all Symmetry roles, Gusto's subsidiary, whose physical office is in Scottsdale. Note: The San Francisco office expectations encompass both the San Francisco and San Jose metro areas. When approved to work from a location other than a Gusto office, a secure, reliable, and consistent internet connection is required. This includes non-office days for hybrid employees.

This role is all about bias to action: owning problems end-to-end, getting working software in front of customers, and iterating quickly. You’ll work closely with a small, senior team to implement language-model-powered experiences. If you like being hands-on, making pragmatic technical decisions, working closely with product &amp;amp; design partners, and turning ideas into production features, you’ll be a great fit.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Team:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We’re a small, focused AI product team building practical, high-impact experiences to help people save for retirement at Gusto Retirement. The team is senior, collaborative, and very execution-focused—PMs bring strong ideas, and we own the execution fully. We work closely with product, design, and partner engineering teams, but keep tight ownership of our priorities and roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s what you’ll do day-to-day:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Design, build, and ship production features that use large language models to solve real customer problems.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Implement and integrate LLMs (prompting, tool loops, evaluation, monitoring, etc).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Make pragmatic architecture decisions, de-risk tricky areas, and keep the work unblocked.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Partner with product and design to refine ideas, shape scope, and iterate quickly on end-to-end experiences.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Collaborate with other engineering teams to integrate with existing systems and unblock dependencies.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Write clear, reliable, well-tested code that ships quickly and scales well.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s what we&#39;re looking for:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;10+ years of software engineering experience building and shipping production products or platforms&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Hands-on experience implementing LLM-powered features (e.g., RAG flows, agents, tool loops, workflow automation with language models, etc)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Strong engineering skills (e.g., services, APIs, data flows); comfortable spending most of your time coding.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience running or heavily contributing to a team’s execution: sprints, Jira, scoping, and cross-functional coordination.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Bias to action: you default to trying things, iterating, and learning, rather than getting stuck in analysis or waiting for direction.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Clear communicator who can work well with product, design, and other engineering teams without needing a formal management title.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experienced with Ruby on Rails (or any comparable language), React (or any comparable library).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please note that travel to Gusto’s Denver office for onboarding is required for this position.&lt;/strong&gt; If you have any questions regarding this requirement, please share with your recruiter.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our cash compensation amount for this role is targeted at $213,000/yr to $236,000/yr in Denver &amp;amp; most remote locations, and $251,000/yr to $278,000/yr for San Francisco, Seattle &amp;amp; New York.
