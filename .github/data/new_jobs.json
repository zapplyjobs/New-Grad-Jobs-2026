    "description": "&lt;p&gt;Customers depend on Datadog’s Incident Management product in crisis moments — when outages threaten their business — and your work will shape how teams respond and learn.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a Product Manager II, you’ll own the product that turns chaos into calm: declaring incidents, rallying responders, coordinating remediation, and turning every outage into a learning opportunity that prevents the next one. This is a broad, technically rich product — you’ll own features across real-time UIs, automation, AI-powered summaries and recommendations, documentation and runbooks, task and incident state management, analytics, and deep integrations with third-party chat and video platforms.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You’ll own the features that reduce Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR) for some of the world’s most complex cloud systems, partnering closely with the rest of the product organization to deliver end-to-end incident response. Your work will be highly visible to customers and internal stakeholders and will shape how organizations run reliable services at scale.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Datadog is uniquely positioned to deliver best-in-class end-to-end incident response by surfacing the right telemetry (metrics, traces, logs), orchestrating responders through alerting and paging, and closing the loop with automation and incident management.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;At Datadog, we place value in our office culture - the relationships and collaboration it builds and the creativity it brings to the table.

    "job_description": "The OpportunityWe are looking for a Stats Engineering leader to help us build two new Datadog products from scratch - Feature Flags and Experiments. Our goal with these products is to help developers and product teams ship features quickly, experiment as second-nature, and make decisions with confidence. To do this, we need to build a world-class experimentation engine, backed by state-of-the-art statistical methods like sequential analysis, CUPED, and change point detection, which help to solve the big problems in the experimentation world of early peeking, long experiment durations, and catching bugs respectively. Because there is often a technical, cultural, and linguistic gap between software engineers and statisticians, our Stats Engineers are unique in that they don't squarely fall into data science or software engineering. Data scientists typically understand the concepts, but may struggle to implement them in production with enterprise grade quality. Software engineers know how to build robust production systems, but can get lost implementing methods that don't have off the shelf frameworks. Here, we need the rare breed of builder who understands statistical concepts and can implement them in production.Our experimentation platform will be used for root-cause analysis and decision-making across our 30,000+ customers of all shapes, sizes, and industries; we’ll help customers run everything from e-commerce-focused A/B tests on user adoption to infrastructure-based canary deployments in real-time to root cause major incidents, and connect the dots together across the worlds of the product manager, data person, and developer. This is a rare opportunity to work with senior leaders across engineering, product, and design to define the foundational components of Datadog’s Product Analytics and APM stack from the ground up, and develop an experimentation engine in an AI-first world. At Datadog, we place value in our office culture - the relationships and collaboration it builds and the creativity it brings to the table.
