    "job_description": "ABOUT RETOOL Nearly every company in the world runs on custom software for critical operations like tracking performance metrics, handling customer support workflows, building admin dashboards, and countless other processes you might not have even thought of. But most companies don't have adequate resources to properly invest in these tools, leading to a lot of old and clunky internal software or, even worse, users still stuck in manual and spreadsheet flows. At Retool, we’re building the first enterprise AppGen platform: software that transforms natural language into production-ready code, integrates directly with business data, and meets the highest standards of security and governance. AI is redefining what it means to build software—and who gets to build it. The definition of “developer” now includes analysts, operators, and domain experts creating solutions directly. As the pool of builders widens, so does the complexity of what they need to build. The opportunity is enormous, but so is the challenge of enabling this larger community to build production-grade software safely. That means AI that understands real business data, enforces enterprise policies automatically, and empowers teams to create once and reuse everywhere with shared, trusted components. Over 100 million hours of work has been automated by developers and domain experts using our platform, freeing them to focus on creative problem-solving and strategic initiatives that drive real business value. The people closest to knowing what needs to be built can now safely create custom solutions within enterprise guardrails. And that's a mission worth striving for. Let's build the future together!WHY WE’RE LOOKING FOR YOU: In the last year, we’ve grown our customer base over 5x and continued to enhance our product.

WHO YOU'LL WORK WITH You’ll work with other support engineers and software engineers to diagnose, troubleshoot, and solve customer problems. You’ll also help train new coworkers on supporting our users. Support is a small team today, but rapidly expanding to match our customer growth. You’ll be joining a broader team of Retools who are passionate about serving our customers, enjoy collaborating to build an incredibly innovative product, and partake in some occasional-but-well-intentioned sarcasm. If this sounds like you, we’d love to hear from you! WHAT YOU’LL DO: Talk to users every day via Service Cloud and sometimes Zoom Teach Retool users best practices around performance and development workflows Explore our codebase, logs, and test instances to debug difficult problems Troubleshoot new bugs and formalize bug reports Represent customers internally and advocate for key issues Contribute to our documentation Help users debug issues with many different database types and APIs Analyze and improve our support operations--there's always new Retool apps to build!

But most companies don&#39;t have adequate resources to properly invest in these tools, leading to a lot of old and clunky internal software or, even worse, users still stuck in manual and spreadsheet flows.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At Retool, we’re building the first enterprise AppGen platform: software that transforms natural language into production-ready code, integrates directly with business data, and meets the highest standards of security and governance. AI is redefining what it means to build software—and who gets to build it. The definition of “developer” now includes analysts, operators, and domain experts creating solutions directly. As the pool of builders widens, so does the complexity of what they need to build. The opportunity is enormous, but so is the challenge of enabling this larger community to build production-grade software safely. That means AI that understands real business data, enforces enterprise policies automatically, and empowers teams to create once and reuse everywhere with shared, trusted components.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://retool.com/blog/retool-automates-100-million-hours-of-work-launching-agents&quot;&gt;Over 100 million hours of work&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has been automated by developers and domain experts using our platform, freeing them to focus on creative problem-solving and strategic initiatives that drive real business value. The people closest to knowing what needs to be built can now safely create custom solutions within enterprise guardrails. And that&#39;s a mission worth striving for.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s build the future together!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHY WE’RE LOOKING FOR YOU:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;table style=&quot;width: 100%; height: 67.1875px;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr style=&quot;height: 67.1875px;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;td style=&quot;width: 98.9621%; height: 67.1875px;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In the last year, we’ve grown our customer base over 5x and continued to enhance our product.
