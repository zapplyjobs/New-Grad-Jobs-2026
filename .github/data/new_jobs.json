    "job_description": "Build to Protect Civilization TRM is a blockchain intelligence company that’s on a mission to build a safer financial system for billions of people. We’re a lean, high-impact team tackling some of the world’s most critical challenges, ranging from human trafficking and financial fraud to terrorist financing. We are builders who power governments, financial institutions, and crypto companies when the clock is running and the consequences are real. This is why every TRMer is a bet on our future and has the power to change our trajectory.At TRM, writing code can literally save lives. Our platform helps governments, financial institutions, and crypto companies detect and prevent financial crime — from terrorist financing to human trafficking. The Full-Stack Product Engineering team builds the core products and services that make this possible, from customer-facing applications to foundational APIs and internal tools. We’re looking for an early-career engineer who’s eager to grow quickly by shipping real-world features and contributing directly to this mission. As a Product Engineer, you’ll work alongside experienced mentors, product managers, and designers to solve complex problems, write production-grade code, and build features that matter. You’ll gain exposure across the full stack—React, Node.js, Postgres—and be part of a high-velocity team building the infrastructure of trust for the crypto economy. The impact you’ll have here: Build and ship full-stack features across TRM’s core products and internal tools, with guidance and mentorship from senior engineers. Collaborate cross-functionally to clarify requirements, ask smart questions, and break down complex problems into shippable pieces. Learn how to design and build APIs and services with scalability, performance, and maintainability in mind. Write clean, tested, and well-documented code that delivers value to TRM’s customers and stakeholders. Continuously improve through feedback, pair programming, code reviews, and retros—bringing curiosity and coachability to every interaction. What we’re looking for: A Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Computer Science or a closely related technical field (completed by Summer 2026). 1–2 software engineering internships, or equivalent experience through academic or personal projects. Familiarity with JavaScript/TypeScript and an interest in full-stack development (React, Node.js, Postgres). An eagerness to learn: you take feedback well and show curiosity about unfamiliar systems or tools. Strong communication skills—you keep your team updated, ask questions early, and can explain your thinking clearly. Demonstrated initiative—whether through a side project, internship, or campus involvement, you’ve shown you can take ownership and see something through. Excitement for TRM’s mission to build a safer financial system for billions of people. About the Team: The team operates on a weekly sprint schedule. Individuals on the team are tasked to lead projects as technical anchors, and given a chance to grow and take ownership according to their level and goals. We work closely with our internal stakeholders to deliver impactful features to our internal customers and the company. The team’s culture is built on psychological safety wherein team members build rapport and trust-based relationships with teammates, hold each other accountable and to a high bar, collaborate extensively, and have lots of fun along the way. The team’s timezone is a mix of EST and PST with at least 6 hours of overlap with PST (8 am to 2 pm PST) On-Call: We have an on-call rotation that is a week long in duration approximately once every 4-6 weeks. On-call requests can be categorized into two large buckets; a) PagerDuty alerts that warrant immediate attention and b) customer support requests from specific Slack channels that an on-call engineer is responsible for triaging and answering. Learn about TRM Speed in this position: Ruthless Prioritization & Adaptability: We adapt quickly when faced with new information. For example, an engineer may message the PM or EM to prioritize Task A vs. Task B in the middle of the sprint – we don’t let inertia guide our decisions. Instead we focus on ruthless prioritization and pivot quickly as needed. Challenging Timelines (Execution Pressure): An engineer questions a teammate’s proposed 3-week timeline, and constructively argues for condensing it to 2 weeks—backed by rationale, tradeoffs, and a plan to reduce scope or increase velocity. They show ownership of delivery speed and willingness to push for urgency. Time-Boxed Spiking (Rapid Learning & Decision-Making): An engineer proposes a 1-week spike with a clear time-box and success criteria to explore implementation options or validate feasibility through a proof of concept. They demonstrate speed not just in execution, but in de-risking decisions early. The following represents the expected range of compensation for this role: Individual pay is determined by skills, qualifications, experience, and location. The compensation details listed in this posting reflect the US base salary only. The estimated base salary range for this role is $130,000 - $150,000. Additionally, this role may be eligible to participate in TRM’s equity plan. Please note – we factor in the different costs for geographies outside the United States. About TRM's Engineering Levels: Engineer: Responsible for helping to define project milestones and executing small decisions independently with the appropriate tradeoffs between simplicity, readability, and performance. Provides mentorship to junior engineers, and enhances operational excellence through tech debt reduction and knowledge sharing. Senior Engineer: Successfully designs and documents system improvements and features for an OKR/project from the ground up. Consistently delivers efficient and reusable systems, optimizes team throughput with appropriate tradeoffs, mentors team members, and enhances cross-team collaboration through documentation and knowledge sharing. Staff Engineer: Drives scoping and execution of one or more OKRs/projects that impact multiple teams. Partners with stakeholders to set the team vision and technical roadmaps for one or more products. Is a role model and mentor to the entire engineering organization.

    "job_description": "BackgroundAt Yuzu, we’re building the next-generation health insurance company. We are NOT building a digital brokerage or an AI wrapper - we are going deeper to build the foundational infrastructure required to power tomorrow’s health plans. We believe that software can unlock the ability to build health insurance that is affordable, adaptable, and scalable. Yuzu’s platform will be core to this future.So how does this actually work? Over 70% of employer-sponsored health plans are self-funded, meaning the employer acts as the insurer and directly covers employees' healthcare costs. This allows companies to customize benefits, gain flexibility, and save money. Self-funded employers partner with a Third-Party Administrator (TPA) to handle the behind-the-scenes plan administration, like processing claims and managing benefits.The TPA industry is a $500bn sleeper industry that has historically been seen as a services business, bogged down by manual processes and legacy systems (for context, our team couldn’t even access these on our Macs).Yuzu is a vertically integrated & tech-enabled TPA, currently servicing thousands of employees. We differentiate by helping innovative health plans come to life by facilitating new ways to pay for and access healthcare covered by insurance. Yuzu’s goal is to make it as easy for any business to create and manage a custom health plan as it is to create a storefront on Shopify.We’re backed by top VC firms and 10+ unicorn founders, including leaders at Stripe, OpenAI, Brex, Deel, Mercury, and Notion, and we’re building a formidable team to tackle the massive opportunity ahead.RoleAs an early-stage startup, Yuzu’s top priority is to ship software fast. We believe that the best way to ship code fast is to invest in clean code, strong CI/CD automation, and a delightful developer experience.Write in Typescript using modern frameworks like SvelteKit and NestjsWrite all of our infrastructure as code, improving security, modularity, and readabilityBuild on top of best-in-class healthcare APIs including Stedi and Flexpa to handle the intricacies of healthcare-specific data structures.Have a clean and new codebase, with little-to-no tech-debt or internal tools with steep learning curvesAs an early employee you willContribute across the entire codebaseSet a large part of Yuzu’s company cultureDirect the focus of our product from an engineering perspectiveQualificationsExperience building successful software projects, ideally independently or as a part of a small team or early-stage startupIn-person 5 days/week in Flatiron NYC office requiredSelf-directed, curious, fast-paced personality with strong communication skillsNice to HavesExperience with Typescript, CDK, and/or AWSExperience in healthcare or fintech infrastructureOur Commitment to YouYou will have significant ownership.
