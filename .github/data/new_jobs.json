Set integration timelines, technical milestones, and success criteria that ensure partners are confident in their implementation approach. Actively guide new partners through an integration journey, utilizing technical documentation, integration guides, sample code, and technical webinars to promote rapid deployment and successful go-to-market. Partner Success &amp; Integration Support Understand immediate integration goals (i.e. initial API integration and testing) as well as long-term partnership opportunities (i.e. advanced features, scaling, and new use cases) to build meaningful technical roadmaps for strategic partners. Deliver frontline technical support for partner integration issues, including Management API troubleshooting, authentication challenges, performance optimization, and architectural guidance. Define requirements for custom integrations and work closely with Engineering teams to scope and prioritize partner-specific platform enhancements. Serve as an internal champion for partners and their technical needs. Work closely with Support, Product, and Engineering to provide integration feedback, identify API improvements, while communicating platform roadmaps to partners. Invest in partner relationships to build trust-based technical partnerships. PSAs work with partners who integrate Supabase into their own platforms and customer offerings, making technical reliability and partnership success paramount. Preferred Experience 6+ years of relevant work experience in Solutions Architecture, API Integration, Partner Engineering, or similar technical partnership roles. Experience with integration platforms, API management tools, and partner ecosystem development. Background in web application development, with familiarity with popular JavaScript frameworks (NextJS, React, Vue, Svelte) as well as Node.js.
