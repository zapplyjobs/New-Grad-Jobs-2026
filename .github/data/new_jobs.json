We are primarily an in-person company based in San Francisco, with growing offices in Atlanta, New York, London, France, Singapore, and Japan. We are guided by a set of values that are at the core of our actions and define our culture: Trust, Customer Obsession, Craftsmanship, Intensity, and Family. These values are the foundation of our work, and we are committed to upholding them in everything we do. Our co-founders are Bret Taylor and Clay Bavor . Bret currently serves as Board Chair of OpenAI. Previously, he was co-CEO of Salesforce (which had acquired the company he founded, Quip) and CTO of Facebook. Bret was also one of Google's earliest product managers and co-creator of Google Maps. Before founding Sierra, Clay spent 18 years at Google, where he most recently led Google Labs. Earlier, he started and led Google’s AR/VR effort, Project Starline, and Google Lens. Before that, Clay led the product and design teams for Google Workspace. What you’ll do Design and deliver production-grade AI agents : You'll build and ship highly performant, reliable, and intuitive AI agents that are central, mission-critical and drive revenue directly to Sierra's growth. These aren't prototypes—they are powerful, scalable systems running in production environments across industries like finance, healthcare, and commerce. Drive the Agent Development Life Cycle (ADLC): You'll have complete ownership and autonomy from initial pilot through deployment and continuous iteration. You'll be responsible for building, tuning, and evolving AI agents in production environments, defining the standard for ADLC best practices along the way. Partner with large enterprises and cutting-edge startups: You’ll work directly with leaders at some of the world’s largest enterprises to understand their most pressing business challenges, and build AI agents that transform how they operate at scale. You'll also partner with the most cutting-edge startups in Silicon Valley, embedding AI agents across their entire business stack to drive innovation and efficiency. Build the future of the platform: Your direct work with customers will guide the evolution of Sierra's core platform. You'll surface unmet needs, prototype new tools and features, and collaborate with research, product, and platform to shape the future of AI agent development and Sierra's product. Example projects These are some examples of projects that engineers on our team have worked on recently: Design and build AI agents for large telecommunications and media companies that consistently outperform human agents in managing subscription churn Develop and refine AI agents capable of navigating complex customer interactions, like troubleshooting a broken device and personalizing product recommendations Create generalizable AI agent frameworks tailored for industry-specific use cases. See some examples in our financial services blog ! Facilitate design partnerships for new product initiatives, such as new agent architectures, self-service capabilities, and generative agent development Experiment with the latest voice models and figure out how to integrate them at scale to enterprise-grade customers What you'll bring Experience building and scaling end-to-end production systems Strong technical problem-solving skills, especially in fast-changing, ambiguous environments A builder and tinkerer’s mindset with high agency - you find creative ways to overcome obstacles and ship Comfort working directly with customers to understand their needs and solve real-world problems Excellent communication skills - clear, direct, and persuasive across technical and non-technical audiences Even better...

We build trust in AI by making it more accessible, safe, and useful. We build trust with each other by showing up for each other professionally and personally, creating an environment that enables all of us to do our best work. Customer Obsession: We deeply understand our customers’ business goals and relentlessly focus on driving outcomes, not just technical milestones. Everyone at the company knows and spends time with our customers. When our customer is having an issue, we drop everything and fix it. Craftsmanship: We get the details right, from the words on the page to the system architecture. We have good taste. When we notice something isn’t right, we take the time to fix it. We are proud of the products we produce. We continuously self-reflect to continuously self-improve. Intensity: We know we don’t have the luxury of patience. We play to win. We care about our product being the best, and when it isn’t, we fix it. When we fail, we talk about it openly and without blame so we succeed the next time. Family: We know that balance and intensity are compatible, and we model it in our actions and processes. We are the best technology company for parents. We support and respect each other and celebrate each other’s personal and professional achievements.

We provide a complete backend solution including Database, Auth, Storage, Edge Functions, Realtime, and Vector Search. All services are deeply integrated and designed for growth.\n\nWe’re seeking a Customer Solutions Architect (CSA) to help drive the adoption of Supabase across a diverse range of customers: from agile startups building towards their first launch to established brands with highly scaled workloads.\n\nAt Supabase, CSA’s are responsible for the entire customer journey, working closely with our most valuable users to:\n\n 1. Uncover and understand business and technical requirements.\n\n 2. Design and architect technical solutions built on the Supabase platform.\n\n 3. Work with customers to lead proof-of-value implementations.\n\n 4. Provide regular customer engagements to answer complex questions, unblock adoption, and optimize scaled performance.\n\nSuccessful CSAs always put customers first, working closely with them to become trusted advisors who understand their needs, work as an extension of their team toward common success, and advocate on behalf of the customer within Supabase.\n\nYou'll be joining our team to support Supabase Team & Enterprise customers, where you will be expected to lead and innovate around the following areas of responsibility:\n\n\nPRE-SALES DISCOVERY\n\n - Lead technical discovery to uncover business and technical objectives, set appropriate expectations of the Supabase platform, and define the criteria for success, ensuring customers can receive the guidance they need to achieve it.\n\n - Design, build, and present Supabase platform demonstrations to high-value customers.

Work closely with Support, Product, and Engineering to provide platform feedback, identify areas of improvement, while communicating platform roadmaps to customers.\n\n - Invest in customer connections to build a trust-based relationship. Everyday CSA’s work with the production data stores of startups and enterprises alike. Building trust in the Success team and Supabase platform is paramount to a successful customer relationship.\n\n\nPREFERRED EXPERIENCE\n\n - 6+ years of relevant work experience in Solutions Architecture, Database Engineering, or similar.\n\n - Strong background with relational database management systems such as PostgreSQL or MySQL.\n\n - Background in web application development, with familiarity with Python, C# and popular JavaScript frameworks (React, Vue, Svelte) as well as Node.js.\n\n - Very strong communication skills, particularly of technical concepts. CSA’s at Supabase spend a significant amount of time translating business needs to technical outcomes, and technical concepts to organizational impact.\n\n - Well-organized and effective storyteller with meaningful interpersonal skills. CSA’s often have to navigate multiple stakeholders with conflicting opinions, and the ability to effectively mediate this type of conflict is crucial.\n\n - Experience with project management, business analysis and revenue operations tools. We use HubSpot, BigQuery etc., and familiarity with these platforms will help enable your success.\n\n - Previous experience leading customer-facing engagements to deliver meaningful technical and business value.\n\n\nWHAT WE OFFER\n\n - Fully Remote\n   \n   We hire globally.

We want everyone to share in the upside of what we’re building together.\n\n - Tech Allowance\n   \n   Use this budget to set up your ideal work environment—laptop, monitor, headphones, or whatever helps you do your best work.\n\n - Health Benefits\n   \n   Supabase covers 100% of health insurance for employees and 80% for dependents, wherever you are. Your wellbeing and your family’s health are important to us.\n\n - Annual Off-Sites\n   \n   Once a year, the entire company gathers in a new city for a week of connection, collaboration, and fun.
