The postdoctoral researcher will work closely with Dr. Geeta Persad at UT Austin in Austin, TX.The Postdoctoral Researcher will contribute to a set of cutting-edge projects focused on understanding and projecting hydroclimate extremes, particularly multivariate and compound events, in the context of rapidly evolving anthropogenic aerosol emissions. Using earth system multi-model large ensemble datasets under the Regional Aerosol Model Intercomparison Project (RAMIP), the Researcher will help quantify the role of aerosols—relative to greenhouse gases—in shaping historical and future hydroclimate extremes. The work will involve developing new theoretical frameworks and methodologies for attributing aerosol-driven hydroclimate hazards, analyzing the confounding effects of structural uncertainty and internal variability, and informing more robust, aerosol-aware climate projections for decision-making and climate resilience. This position offers the opportunity to contribute to high-impact, interdisciplinary climate science at the intersection of modeling, attribution, and policy-relevant research.The position is available to begin as soon as possible, preferably no later than December 2025, and is expected to be 1 year in duration. The position carries an annual salary of $70,000 (plus benefits) and funding for publications and travel to a professional conference. The Postdoctoral Researcher will have access to mentorship, networking, and professional development resources offered through the Jackson School for Geosciences and the University of Texas Office of Postdoctoral Affairs. This position is funded by federal grants from NOAA and NSF and is subject to availability of funding.Interested applicants are strongly encouraged to contact Dr. Geeta Persad (geeta.persad@jsg.utexas.edu)  directly with any questions.The deadline to submit applications for full consideration is September 15, 2025.
