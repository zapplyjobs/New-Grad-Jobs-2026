From idea to product, Figma empowers teams to streamline workflows, move faster, and work together in real time from anywhere in the world. If you're excited to shape the future of design and collaboration, join us! Figma is all-in on AI — not just as a feature, but as a foundational shift in how we build, scale, and serve our users. As our CEO and executive team have shared, AI is central to Figma’s long-term product strategy, and we're investing deeply across the stack: from model quality and infrastructure reliability to data pipelines and evaluation workflows. We’re hiring a seasoned Technical Program Manager (TPM) to help lead the platform side of that work — building scalable systems to support annotation, capacity planning, and model delivery. This is a technical, execution-heavy role for a seasoned TPM who would be excited to solve AI reliability, scale, and data quality in equal parts. You’ll partner closely with engineering, infra, design, AI research, and product teams to manage cross-org delivery of our most important AI Services — and help ensure our infra and evaluation loops scale to meet real product demand. If you’re comfortable working across quota tracking, labeling pipelines, cost modeling, and launch readiness — this role was made for you.
