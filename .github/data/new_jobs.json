    "job_description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the Role Enterprise is central to Anthropic's mission. The organizations that could benefit most from Claude in healthcare, financial services, and government are often the most demanding buyers, with rigorous requirements around security, compliance, and control. We believe earning their trust is essential to ensuring AI benefits the world broadly. We're looking for an engineering leader to build and scale our Enterprise Foundations team. This team owns the foundational systems that make Claude work for large organizations: the admin experiences, billing controls, identity and access management, and deployment systems that let Fortune 500 companies adopt Claude with confidence. You'll be responsible for making it dramatically easier for enterprises to buy, deploy, and manage Claude across their entire organization, with direct day to day impact on unlocking business outcomes. This role sits at the intersection of enterprise product, platform infrastructure, and go-to-market. You'll partner closely with product, design, sales, and customer success to understand what our largest customers need, then translate those requirements into scalable technical solutions. The work spans unified administration across Anthropic's product suite, consumption-based pricing and billing, enterprise identity and permissions, and meeting the deployment requirements of regulated industries. Responsibilities Build and lead a high-performing team of engineers focused on enterprise admin, billing, identity, and deployment infrastructure Own the technical strategy for enterprise platform systems Drive development of scalable systems that let enterprises deploy, manage, and scale Claude usage across their organizations Partner on deployment requirements for regulated industries including compliance certifications, data residency, and multi-cloud availability Work closely with sales, customer success, and GTM teams to identify enterprise blockers and translate them into prioritized engineering work Create clarity and direction for the team in a fast-moving environment where enterprise requirements evolve rapidly You May Be a Good Fit If You Have 5+ years of experience as an engineering manager, with at least 3 years leading teams building enterprise SaaS platforms Strong technical background with hands-on experience building admin experiences, billing systems, or identity/access management platforms Experience with enterprise identity management including SSO integration, SCIM provisioning, and RBAC systems at scale Track record shipping billing and pricing infrastructure—ideally including consumption/usage-based models or enterprise contract management Experience building systems that scale from small teams to large enterprise deployments (500K+ user organizations) Excellent communication skills and ability to work effectively across product, design, sales, customer success, and security functions Strong Candidates May Also Have Experience with AI/ML products and understanding how enterprises evaluate and deploy AI tools Background with compliance frameworks for regulated industries (SOC2, HIPAA) and enterprise audit logging requirements Experience with multi-cloud deployments or marketplace distribution (AWS, GCP, Azure) Familiarity with data residency and sovereignty requirements across global regions Startup experience, particularly in scaling enterprise platforms from early adoption to broad deployment The expected base compensation for this position is below. Our total compensation package for full-time employees includes equity, benefits, and may include incentive compensation.Annual Salary:$405,000 - $485,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the role At Anthropic, we're building AI systems that are safe, beneficial, and transformative. Our mission is to develop AI that benefits humanity, and we believe the most powerful capabilities emerge when we thoughtfully bridge the gap between research breakthroughs and real-world applications. Anthropic Labs serves as our internal accelerator. We're looking for the next breakout hits that bring substantial revenue or transform an industry. We operate in close partnership with research and build through fast iteration cycles. Past successes include Claude Code and MCP. We're seeking versatile, entrepreneurial engineers to join Labs. In this role, you'll work at the intersection of cutting-edge research and real-world application, rapidly building and testing new experiences, working directly with researchers and users, and generating the insights that shape Anthropic's product future. You'll need to be comfortable with ambiguity, willing to kill your own projects when the data says to, and energized by the pace of building in uncharted territory. Responsibilities Rapidly prototype full-stack applications that showcase emerging AI capabilities, shipping early and often to maximize learning Collaborate closely with research teams to understand new model capabilities and translate them into intuitive user experiences Work directly with internal test users and external partners to gather feedback, iterate quickly, and validate (or invalidate) product concepts Design and run structured experiments to test hypotheses, balancing creative exploration with rigorous evaluation Generate documentation and insights to guide successful prototypes toward full product teams Advocate for user experience and product considerations early in the research process Provide feedback to research teams about model effectiveness and where capabilities can be improved Flexibly contribute across Labs initiatives based on organizational priorities and emerging opportunities—context from one project should inform the next You may be a good fit if you Have 8+ years of experience building full-stack applications, with a track record of zero-to-one work in startup or startup-like environments Thrive in ambiguity and are energized (not anxious) by uncertainty—you're comfortable working on projects that might not exist in three months Have a hacker mentality: high agency, bias toward shipping, comfort with technical debt when it's the right tradeoff Are deeply user-centric—you validate ideas with actual users before over-investing and talk about problems before solutions Can articulate learnings from failed or killed projects without defensiveness; you treat your work as experiments Hold strong opinions loosely—you advocate forcefully for ideas but change your mind based on evidence Are a generalist who can transition between different problem spaces as priorities shift Work independently with good judgment about what matters, without needing constant direction Have strong technical skills across modern web development stacks (React, Node.js, Python, etc.) and are comfortable with APIs, databases, and cloud technologies Communicate effectively and translate complex AI capabilities into intuitive experiences Care about the societal impacts and ethics of your work Strong candidates may also have Experience building products that involve AI/ML components or working with large language models Experience collaborating directly with research teams in AI/ML environments Background conducting user research, interviews, and usability testing Experience across both B2B and B2C product development, or in multiple industries Design sensibility or hands-on experience with UI/UX for AI-powered applications Experience with real-time applications, WebSocket implementations, or complex frontend interactions What we're not looking for at this stage Deep specialists who can't adapt if their domain becomes irrelevant Engineers who've only succeeded in big-company structures with well-defined processes and long timelines People who are precious about their work or frame all past projects as successes Those who need clear roadmaps and get stressed by shifting priorities Candidates need not have 100% of the skills listed above Formal certifications or education credentials Direct machine learning or AI research experience Deadline to apply: None.

However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

But most companies don't have adequate resources to properly invest in these tools, leading to a lot of old and clunky internal software or, even worse, users still stuck in manual and spreadsheet flows. At Retool, we’re building the first enterprise AppGen platform: software that transforms natural language into production-ready code, integrates directly with business data, and meets the highest standards of security and governance. AI is redefining what it means to build software—and who gets to build it. The definition of “developer” now includes analysts, operators, and domain experts creating solutions directly. As the pool of builders widens, so does the complexity of what they need to build.

    "description": "&lt;div class=&quot;content-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ABOUT RETOOL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Nearly every company in the world runs on custom software for critical operations like tracking performance metrics, handling customer support workflows, building admin dashboards, and countless other processes you might not have even thought of. But most companies don&#39;t have adequate resources to properly invest in these tools, leading to a lot of old and clunky internal software or, even worse, users still stuck in manual and spreadsheet flows.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At Retool, we’re building the first enterprise AppGen platform: software that transforms natural language into production-ready code, integrates directly with business data, and meets the highest standards of security and governance. AI is redefining what it means to build software—and who gets to build it. The definition of “developer” now includes analysts, operators, and domain experts creating solutions directly. As the pool of builders widens, so does the complexity of what they need to build. The opportunity is enormous, but so is the challenge of enabling this larger community to build production-grade software safely. That means AI that understands real business data, enforces enterprise policies automatically, and empowers teams to create once and reuse everywhere with shared, trusted components.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://retool.com/blog/retool-automates-100-million-hours-of-work-launching-agents&quot;&gt;Over 100 million hours of work&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has been automated by developers and domain experts using our platform, freeing them to focus on creative problem-solving and strategic initiatives that drive real business value. The people closest to knowing what needs to be built can now safely create custom solutions within enterprise guardrails. And that&#39;s a mission worth striving for.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s build the future together!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHY WE’RE LOOKING FOR YOU&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We’re looking for a UX Researcher to inform our product and design strategy through one of tech’s most transformative shifts: the fusion of developer tools and AI. At Retool, we’re reimagining how software gets built in the era of AI, and your research will light the way.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You’ll be a foundational member on a small, strategic research team, with an opportunity to shape the culture of research at Retool and define how insights drive impact across the organization. Though a new function, research is already deeply valued across the organization, informing key strategic designs and guiding our expansion into new customer segments and AI-powered experiences. You’ll collaborate with a curious and customer-centric group of designers, engineers, and product managers who are eager to partner with research to uncover new opportunities to elevate our products.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT YOU&#39;LL DO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In this role, you’ll own research initiatives to inform product strategy and design, collaborating closely with cross-functional teams to deliver insights that shape Retool’s future. You will:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Work with stakeholders to identify knowledge gaps, latent assumptions, and open questions to prioritize opportunities for impactful research.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Plan, conduct, and analyze studies leveraging a range of qualitative and quantitative methods—from tactical usability tests, to in-depth interviews, in-product surveys, and more—to generate actionable learnings.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Balance speed with research rigor, creatively leveraging research methods to work within constraints.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Triangulate insights from across user research, product usage, support, and market signals, to surface meaningful patterns.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Distill complex data into clear, compelling stories for teams across the org, from product, design, and engineering peers to executive stakeholders.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As an early member of the research team, you’ll also collaborate with your teammates to shape our research practice, evolve our processes, and help embed user-centered thinking across everything we do.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE SKILLSET YOU&#39;LL BRING&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;4+ years of experience in UX research, product research, or a related field, ideally in B2B or technical product environments&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Proven ability to own research projects end-to-end, from scoping through to execution and analysis, leveraging a range of qualitative and quantitative methods&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Strong synthesis and storytelling skills, with an ability to distill ambiguity into clarity and make insights resonate with diverse audiences&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience shaping product direction through early-stage generative research and iterative usability testing&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Comfort working in ambiguous problem spaces and a bias toward action—you&#39;re as strategic as you are scrappy&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Deep curiosity about how complex systems work, especially technical workflows or developer tools&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Excellent collaboration and communication skills, with an understanding for how to bring others into the process and rally teams around user insights&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ability to manage multiple priorities, scope projects appropriately, and deliver high-quality work on time&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Additional nice-to-haves:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Bachelor’s or advanced degree in Human-Computer Interaction, Psychology, Human Factors, Computer Science, or similar field&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience working on AI products, along with an understanding of how these technologies work and implications for how users interact with them&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with design thinking frameworks, usability evaluation techniques, and A/B testing&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A portfolio of work that demonstrates the ability to drive measurable business impact by informing product and design decisions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;For candidates based in San Francisco, the pay range(s) for this role is listed below and represents base salary range for non-commissionable roles or on-target earnings (OTE) for commissionable roles.

But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.
