    "description": "&lt;div class=&quot;content-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ready to be pushed beyond what you think you’re capable of?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At Coinbase, our mission is to increase economic freedom in the world. It’s a massive, ambitious opportunity that demands the best of us, every day, as we build the emerging onchain platform — and with it, the future global financial system.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To achieve our mission, we’re seeking a very specific candidate. We want someone who is passionate about our mission and who believes in the power of crypto and blockchain technology to update the financial system. We want someone who is eager to leave their mark on the world, who relishes the pressure and privilege of working with high caliber colleagues, and who actively seeks feedback to keep leveling up. We want someone who will run towards, not away from, solving the company’s hardest problems.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coinbase.com/mission&quot;&gt;work culture&lt;/a&gt; is intense and isn’t for everyone. But if you want to build the future alongside others who excel in their disciplines and expect the same from you, there’s no better place to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While many roles at Coinbase are remote-first, we are not remote-only. In-person participation is required throughout the year. Team and company-wide offsites are held multiple times annually to foster collaboration, connection, and alignment. Attendance is expected and fully supported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Client Strategist (CS) team is a key function within Coinbase Asset Management (CBAM). At CBAM a CS’s job is to build the business. This includes engaging prospects and developing them into clients (if appropriate).&amp;nbsp; At CBAM a Client Strategist is a hybrid between a salesperson and an investment strategist. A successful Client Strategist can secure the next 2-3 meetings during the initial conversation, and drive a deal towards funding. Post funding, Client Strategists design and deliver investor support, in concert with CBAM’s Director of Marketing and IR. A Strategist must understand the nuances of our business, such that they can represent the investment team and our investment process across regions. Client Strategists also contribute to marketing content, turning client feedback and market intelligence into better marketing narratives and better marketing collateral.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you’ll be doing (ie. job duties):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;50-70%: Supporting outbound selling of CBAM funds and strategies in North America, Europe, Asia as led by the firm’s President.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;20-40%: Driving outbound selling of CBAM funds and strategies to institutional allocators across US Wealth, RIA, Family Office.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Research, propose, and execute Go-To_Market (GTM).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Develop deep relationships with and understanding of Institutional Allocators (Pensions, Sovereign Wealth Fund, Endowments, Foundations,&amp;nbsp; Wealth platforms, HNW and UHNW).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Drive maintenance and growth of the CBAM client base.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;10%-20%: Assisting in creation and maintenance of marketing collateral, in concert with the head of Marketing &amp;amp; IR.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we look for in you (ie. job requirements):&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;7+ years of institutional sales experience at top tier global institutional asset manager.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Significant experience independently building relationships with Institutional Allocators.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;In particular, this role needs experience with allocators, RIAs, Wealth platforms in the US and EU, especially Wealth (Multi-family and Single Family offices).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with, and ability to describe, investment concepts across Macro, Systematic, Private Credit, and Fundamental strategies.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Strong working knowledge of digital assets, blockchain technology, crypto market structure, and an ability to drive interest in digital asset investment strategies.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Demonstrated capability to operate independently, to be flexible and to be relentless.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;An ability to receive and give hard feedback.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Technical curiosity, deep interest in digital assets, markets, innovative technology.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Working familiarly with Bloomberg, Excel, Powerpoint &amp;amp; Salesforce.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nice to haves:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Technical skills beyond above: ai, coding, python, statistical analysis.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Working understanding of crypto that can be demonstrated in high pressure meetings.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Professional investment designations: CFA, CAIA.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Strong understanding of region marketing rules and regulations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Series 3 or 7.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Role requires substantial travel.
