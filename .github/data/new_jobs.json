How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the role Anthropic is seeking a Director of UI Engineering to lead the teams responsible for building all consumer-facing Claude experiences—including web, mobile, desktop, and browser extensions. In this role, you'll shape how millions of users interact with Claude daily, driving the technical vision and execution for interfaces that are intuitive, responsive, and push the boundaries of what AI-powered applications can be. This is a highly technical leadership role. While you'll be responsible for building and guiding engineering teams, you'll remain deeply hands-on— steering architectural decisions and staying close to the work. You'll partner closely with Product, Design, Research, and Go-to-Market teams to not only build what's on the roadmap, but to anticipate where the product needs to go next. We're looking for someone who can see around corners and help us skate to where the puck is going. We're building at an extraordinary pace in a rapidly evolving space. You should thrive in environments where priorities shift quickly, where you're expected to ship fast without sacrificing quality, and where the problems you're solving don't have established playbooks.

    "description": "&lt;div class=&quot;content-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Anthropic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is seeking a Director of UI Engineering to lead the teams responsible for building all consumer-facing Claude experiences—including web, mobile, desktop, and browser extensions. In this role, you&#39;ll shape how millions of users interact with Claude daily, driving the technical vision and execution for interfaces that are intuitive, responsive, and push the boundaries of what AI-powered applications can be.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a highly technical leadership role. While you&#39;ll be responsible for building and guiding engineering teams, you&#39;ll remain deeply hands-on— steering architectural decisions and staying close to the work. You&#39;ll partner closely with Product, Design, Research, and Go-to-Market teams to not only build what&#39;s on the roadmap, but to anticipate where the product needs to go next. We&#39;re looking for someone who can see around corners and help us skate to where the puck is going.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re building at an extraordinary pace in a rapidly evolving space. You should thrive in environments where priorities shift quickly, where you&#39;re expected to ship fast without sacrificing quality, and where the problems you&#39;re solving don&#39;t have established playbooks.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Lead and grow the UI engineering teams responsible for Claude&#39;s consumer products across web, mobile (iOS/Android), desktop, and browser extensions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Define the technical vision and architecture for our frontend systems, ensuring they scale with our rapidly growing user base&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Stay deeply technical—participate in design reviews and architectural decisions while maintaining a broad view of the product&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Partner closely with Product and Design to shape product direction, bringing an informed point of view on what we should build and how users will experience it&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Drive engineering excellence through best practices in performance, accessibility, and cross-platform consistency&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build and mentor a world-class team of frontend engineers, creating an environment where people do the best work of their careers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Collaborate across functions—including Research, Trust &amp;amp; Safety, and Go-to-Market—to ensure our products meet the needs of users and the business&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Navigate ambiguity and make sound decisions quickly in a fast-moving environment&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You may be a good fit if you:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have 10+ years of experience building consumer-facing web and mobile applications at scale, with several years in engineering leadership roles&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have led teams that shipped products used by millions of users, with a track record of delivering high-quality, responsive, and accessible interfaces&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Remain deeply technical despite your leadership responsibilities—you can dive into the code, debug complex issues, and make informed architectural tradeoffs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have strong opinions on product and design, developed through years of building consumer experiences, and can advocate effectively for the user&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Excel at cross-functional partnership and can build trust quickly with Product, Design, Research, and other stakeholders&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Thrive in fast-paced, ambiguous environments and can balance speed with quality&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are excited by the challenge of building interfaces for AI-powered products, where the interaction paradigms are still being invented&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Care deeply about craft—you notice the details that make an experience feel polished and intuitive&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong candidates may also have:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience building products across multiple platforms (web, iOS, Android, desktop, browser extensions) and understanding the unique constraints of each&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Background in building real-time, interactive applications where latency and performance are critical&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience with modern frontend frameworks and architectures (React, React Native, TypeScript, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with AI/ML-powered products and the unique UX challenges they present&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A track record of building and scaling engineering teams through periods of rapid growth&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience establishing frontend platform capabilities that enable faster iteration across multiple product surfaces&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deadline to apply&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;None.

However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day.

At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time.
