    "description": "&lt;div class=&quot;content-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discord is used by over 200 million people every month for many different reasons, but there’s one thing that nearly everyone does on our platform:&lt;strong&gt; play video games.&lt;/strong&gt; Over 90% of our users play games, spending a combined 1.5 billion hours playing thousands of unique titles on Discord each month. Discord plays a uniquely important role in the future of gaming. We are focused on making it easier and more fun for people to talk and hang out before, during, and after playing games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Design Systems team is a cross-functional team that ensures design quality across all facets of UI, content, and graphics. We develop the core primitives and standards that engineers and designers use to build Discord’s products. Designers and engineers on this team collaborate closely to accelerate product feature teams’ ability to ship new features with UI that are accessible, consistent, and high quality. This team also sets the standard for accessibility on Discord, and supports other engineering teams in achieving it. As such, the Design Systems team plays a critical role enabling Discord to achieve its core mission: creating a space for everyone to find belonging.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What You&#39;ll Be Doing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Leading the team’s technical direction and architecture of the engineering foundations that underpin our frontend primitives.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Working closely with our engineers and designers to build and maintain our design system, Mana, (design tokens, components, and other code patterns) and improve it over time.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Authoring beautiful, accessible components that work across all our supported platforms (iOS, Android, desktop, and web).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Building internal tools like Figma plugins, asset pipelines, codemods, and lint rules to empower all of our engineers and designers to use the design system to the fullest extent.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Providing guidance to teams on the best way to use design systems components and tools across their projects through pairing and documentation.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Creating interactive prototypes to communicate your work and using user research &amp;amp; data to inform your reasoning&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Inspiring the entire team and our internal partners by bringing new ideas to the table and implementing them as next-generation product primitives.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Mentoring engineers and setting high engineer standards through code and RFC review and championing UI/UX quality at Discord.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you should have&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;8+ years of work experience as a software engineer building, shipping, and iterating on product features or internal tools.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;4+ years experience working on a design system.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Expertise with web (React, TypeScript) and mobile (React Native, Swift, Objective-C, Kotlin) client-focused development.

We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.

How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",
