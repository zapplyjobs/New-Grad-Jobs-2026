We handle the hard stuff—like payroll, health insurance, 401(k)s, and HR—so owners can focus on their craft and customers. With teams in Denver, San Francisco, and New York, we’re proud to support more than 400,000 small businesses across the country, and we’re building a workplace that represents and celebrates the customers we serve. Learn more about our Total Rewards philosophy. About the Team: This team powers the technology, data, and processes that enable Gusto’s go-to-market (GTM) organization to operate with clarity, efficiency, and scale. We build and manage the Salesforce ecosystem and connected GTM tools that drive how Sales and Marketing engage with prospects and customers. Our mission is to create a seamless, data-driven foundation for growth — ensuring every GTM team has the insights, automation, and systems they need to deliver exceptional customer experiences and drive predictable revenue. The team partners closely with Sales, Revenue Operations, and Growth leadership to translate strategy into scalable systems that improve pipeline visibility, forecasting accuracy, and sales productivity. As part of the broader Growth organization, we sit at the intersection of technology and business strategy — responsible for architecting and evolving the platforms that fuel Gusto’s revenue engine. With growing investment in AI and automation, the team plays a critical role in shaping how Gusto uses intelligent systems to identify ideal customers, personalize engagement, and accelerate growth. Here’s what you’ll do day-to-day: Own and Evolve: Lead the strategy, architecture, and evolution of Gusto’s GTM business systems — including Salesforce and connected tools — to power how our Sales and Marketing teams engage customers, manage pipeline, and drive revenue growth. Define the Vision: Establish and execute a multi-year roadmap for GTM systems that aligns with company growth priorities — ensuring scalability, data integrity, and cross-functional alignment across Growth, RevOps, and Engineering. Partner Cross-Functionally: Collaborate closely with Sales, Revenue Operations, Growth, and Finance leaders to translate business needs into scalable systems and process solutions that improve forecasting accuracy, sales productivity, and customer experience. Leverage AI and Automation: Integrate AI-driven capabilities into GTM systems — such as lead scoring, forecasting, prioritization, and personalized engagement — to accelerate decision-making and drive smarter, data-informed growth. Lead and Develop: Manage and mentor a team of Business Systems Analysts, fostering a culture of technical excellence, collaboration, and continuous improvement. Drive Adoption and Change: Champion new tools and processes across GTM teams, ensuring seamless adoption, strong communication, and measurable business impact. Here’s what we're looking for: 10+ years of experience leading GTM Business Systems teams in a high-growth environment, with deep expertise in Salesforce architecture, configuration, and administration. Proven track record of designing, integrating, and scaling Salesforce and related GTM platforms to enable efficient sales execution and predictable revenue growth. Hands-on technical fluency — comfortable diving into system configuration, automation, and data modeling to diagnose and solve complex problems directly. Experience leading and developing Business Systems Analysts and cross-functional project teams, fostering a culture of technical excellence, business alignment, and operational rigor. Strong partnership orientation, with demonstrated success collaborating closely with Sales, RevOps, Growth, and Finance to translate strategy into scalable systems and processes. Strategic thinker and systems architect, able to balance quick delivery with long-term design principles, aligning technology investments with GTM and company growth objectives. Proven ability to leverage AI and automation within GTM systems to identify ideal customers, prioritize opportunities, and personalize engagement. Change leader and communicator, adept at driving adoption across Sales and GTM teams, managing stakeholders, and influencing executives through clarity, trust, and results. Our cash compensation amount for this role is targeted at $155,000 to $194,000/yr in Denver, $184,000 to $229,000/yr for San Francisco, New York, & Seattle.
