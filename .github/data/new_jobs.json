How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a Strategic Account Executive focused on cybersecurity, you&#39;ll own some of Anthropic&#39;s most strategic cybersecurity relationships—companies building the next generation of AI-powered security products. These aren&#39;t typical enterprise accounts; they&#39;re partners shaping how AI transforms the entire security industry.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You&#39;ll drive multi-million dollar commitments by expanding Claude&#39;s footprint across customer product portfolios (AI-powered SOC, threat detection, security copilots) and internal operations (Claude Code for engineering teams). You&#39;ll work at the intersection of executive relationships and technical depth—one week you&#39;re in a CTO strategy session, the next you&#39;re helping an engineering team scope an agentic deployment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This role requires someone who can think like a partner, not just a seller. You&#39;ll collaborate closely with our Applied AI team on custom deployments, work with Product on cybersecurity-specific capabilities, and help shape Anthropic&#39;s go-to-market in one of our highest-potential verticals.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Win business and drive revenue within a book of strategic cybersecurity accounts.Own the full sales cycle from prospecting to close&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Drive expansion across multiple buying centers within strategic accounts—product teams building customer-facing AI features, platform teams deploying Claude Code to engineering orgs, and security research teams exploring frontier capabilities&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Navigate complex organizational structures across security, product, engineering, and executive teams.

Analyze account landscape, competitive dynamics, and emerging security trends to inform targeted sales activities&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Identify and develop use cases across security operations (SecOps automation, threat hunting, alert triage), security product development (AI-powered detection, intelligent response), and internal security functions&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Navigate unique considerations of AI in security contexts, including model guardrails, responsible deployment, and emerging use cases like AI red-teaming&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Own sophisticated deal cycles involving security evaluations, red team assessments, and complex procurement processes.
