Since the project, we&#39;ve provided services to more than 425 local government election websites in 33 states.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.1.1.1/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.1.1.1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;: We released&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.1.1.1/&quot;&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;1.1.1.1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver.

How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.
