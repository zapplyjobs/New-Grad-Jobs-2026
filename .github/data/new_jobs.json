At Samsara, we are helping improve the safety, efficiency and sustainability of the physical operations that power our global economy. Representing more than 40% of global GDP, these industries are the infrastructure of our planet, including agriculture, construction, field services, transportation, and manufacturing — and we are excited to help digitally transform their operations at scale.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 300; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Working at Samsara means you’ll help define the future of physical operations and be on a team that’s shaping an exciting array of product solutions, including Video-Based Safety, Vehicle Telematics, Apps and Driver Workflows, and Equipment Monitoring. As part of a recently public company, you’ll have the autonomy and support to make an impact as we build for the long term.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the role:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Account Development Representative (ADR) job is the launching point for an individual looking for a successful career in SaaS sales. In this role, you will be at the front of Samsara’s go-to-market strategy. This includes hunting for leads, mapping enterprise accounts, and building demand for Samsara’s full line of products. This role is ideal for individuals looking to develop enterprise technology sales skills and to advance their careers. Successful ADRs earn accelerated commissions and head down the path for promotion into closing roles. You will work closely with top-tier executives and will see up close how sales organizations succeed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is a hybrid position open to candidates residing in Phoenix, Arizona.

Successful ADRs can see promotion to a closing role in two years or less.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You love talking to people: In this role you will average 30-50 calls to prospective customers daily.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You have innate curiosity in how businesses work: One day you’ll meet with someone in waste management and the next you may be learning about the inner workings of a food distribution center. Our top sales team members seek to learn the ins and outs of the businesses they support in order to make a larger impact.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You treat rejection as a learning experience: In this role, you will get hung up on and you will get told no. You need to have resilience to pick up the phone again and again to sell Samsara’s mission.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You want to be with the best: Samsara’s high-performance Sales culture means you’ll be surrounded by the best and challenged to go farther than you have before.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimum requirements for this role:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ability and willingness to make 30-50 cold calls a day.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;At least 1 year of sales experience and/or sales prospecting ability.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An ideal candidate has:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Must demonstrate a growth mindset and a willingness to be collaborative with your teammates and in your selling process&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;6 Months experience with Salesforce, LI Sales Navigator, Zoom Info.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;6 Months experience selling into enterprise sized accounts&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;#LI-Hybrid&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Annual on-target earnings (OTE) range for full-time employees for this position is below and depends on your city of residence.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-range&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$64,260&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;divider&quot;&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;$73,440 USD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Samsara, we welcome everyone regardless of their background.
