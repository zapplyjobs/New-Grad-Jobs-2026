    "job_description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.Anthropic’s Audio team pushes the boundaries of what's possible with audio with large language models. We care about making safe, steerable, reliable systems that can understand and generate speech and audio, prioritizing not only naturalness but also steerability and robustness. As a researcher on the Audio team, you'll work across the full stack of audio ML, developing audio codecs and representations, sourcing and synthesizing high quality audio data, training large-scale speech language models and large audio diffusion models, and developing novel architectures for incorporating continuous signals into LLMs. Our team focuses primarily but not exclusively on speech, building advanced steerable systems spanning end-to-end conversational systems, speech and audio understanding models, and speech synthesis capabilities. The team works closely with many collaborators across pretraining, finetuning, reinforcement learning, production inference, and product to get advanced audio technologies from early research to high impact real-world deployments. You may be a good fit if you: Have hands-on experience with training audio models, whether that's conversational speech-to-speech, speech translation, speech recognition, text-to-speech, diarization, codecs, or generative audio models Genuinely enjoy both research and engineering work, and you'd describe your ideal split as roughly 50/50 rather than heavily weighted toward one or the other Are comfortable working across abstraction levels, from signal processing fundamentals to large-scale model training and inference optimization Have deep expertise with JAX, PyTorch, or large-scale distributed training, and can debug performance issues across the full stack Thrive in fast-moving environments where the most important problem might shift as we learn more about what works Communicate clearly and collaborate effectively; audio touches many parts of our systems, so you'll work closely with teams across the company Are passionate about building conversational AI that feels natural, steerable, and safe Care about the societal impacts of voice AI and want to help shape how these systems are developed responsibly Strong candidates may also have experience with: Large language model pretraining and finetuning Training diffusion models for image and audio generation Reinforcement learning for large language models and diffusion models End-to-end system optimization, from performance benchmarking to kernel optimization GPUs, Kubernetes, PyTorch, or distributed training infrastructure Representative projects: Training state-of-the art neural audio codecs for 48 kHz stereo audio Developing novel algorithms for diffusion pretraining and reinforcement learning Scaling audio datasets to millions of hours of high quality audio Creating robust evaluation methodologies for hard-to-measure qualities such as naturalness or expressiveness Studying training dynamics of mixed audio-text language models Optimizing latency and inference throughput for deployed streaming audio systems The annual compensation range for this role is listed below. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.Annual Salary:$350,000 - $500,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

    "description": "&lt;p&gt;Our mission at Duolingo is to develop the best education in the world and make it universally available. It’s a big mission, and that’s where you come in!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At Duolingo, you’ll join a team that cares about educating our users, experimenting with big ideas, making fact-based decisions, and finding innovative solutions to complex problems. You’ll have limitless learning opportunities and daily collaborations with world-class minds — while doing work that’s both meaningful and fun.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Join our life-changing mission to develop education for our half a billion (and growing!) learners around the world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Read &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.duolingo.com/?utm_source=greenhouse.com&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=generalblog_gh_091224&quot;&gt;our blog&lt;/a&gt; to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Duolingo is seeking a Staff Data Scientist to own and evolve our most critical financial forecasting systems. This is a high-stakes, high-visibility role at the center of our business strategy, where experimentation, subscription dynamics, and product development converge. You will work closely with Monetization product and engineering leadership, the finance team, and senior company executives to produce forecasts that are not only accurate but explainable, trusted, and decision-ready.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are looking for someone who deeply understands the statistical and strategic challenges of modeling constantly evolving consumer subscription products. You will need to separate signal from noise, lead investigations when reality diverges from prediction, clearly communicate the business and product impacts of modeling outcomes, and give senior leaders confidence in your numbers when the stakes are high.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:brain:&amp;nbsp; You will...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lead the financial forecasting system.&lt;/strong&gt; Drive methodology, implementation, maintenance, and delivery as the technical owner of our revenue forecasting stack, in close partnership with the finance team. Publish forecasts that serve as the source of truth for company-wide planning and investor-facing decisions.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Model subscription + experimentation dynamics. &lt;/strong&gt;Develop modeling architectures that account for experimental lift, cohort behavior, seasonality, and more, making it clear what’s real impact and what’s noise across the hundreds of experiments Duolingo runs each quarter.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investigate deviations and lead with insight. &lt;/strong&gt;When forecasts miss, lead the root-cause analysis by quantifying drivers of over- or under-performance (e.g. product changes, user behavior shifts, macro trends), collaborating across functions, and clearly communicating what happened and why to senior leadership. Build and be responsible for the statistics, tools, and dashboards that scale these insights across the company.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advance the technical frontier. &lt;/strong&gt;Push our evolution beyond traditional time-series extrapolation and toward more sophisticated approaches such as cohort-based forecasting, retention chaining, and/or causal impact modeling, grounded in business realism and model interpretability.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mentor and influence. &lt;/strong&gt;Serve as a technical mentor to data scientists across the organization, set a high standard for modeling, communication, and statistical rigor, and develop roadmaps for forecasting infrastructure and innovation.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:check:&amp;nbsp; You have...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forecasting domain expertise&lt;/strong&gt;. 6+ years of proven experience building production-grade forecasting systems, with deep applied knowledge of subscription models and understanding of churn dynamics, cohort behaviors, and retention curves.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advanced technical and statistical skills. &lt;/strong&gt;Advanced degree (Masters or PhD) in Data Science, Economics, Statistics, or a related quantitative field with experience assessing and applying theoretical approaches in real-world situations (ex. when to use Bayesian structural models, when causal inference is vital, when a robust heuristic is better than over-fitting noise, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Executive communication&lt;/strong&gt;. Experience distilling uncertainty, nuance, and model tradeoffs into streamlined, actionable narratives for finance and senior leadership partners. Ability to communicate complex forecasting logic clearly and stand by your work in moments of ambiguity.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collaborative style. &lt;/strong&gt;Track record of collaboration across technical and non-technical teams, with a consistent record of integrating feedback, aligning across functions, and operating with a strong sense of ownership and service.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Business responsiveness. &lt;/strong&gt;Strong judgment when balancing model complexity, interpretability, and speed of development, sometimes sacrificing exactness for interpretability. Adapt quickly to fast-paced product and business changes and make model tradeoffs accordingly.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Code quality and reproducibility.&lt;/strong&gt; Expertise writing clean, well-documented code in Python and SQL, and building reliable, multipurpose production pipelines.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experience in high-experimentation environments.&lt;/strong&gt; Past work in organizations where A/B testing is constant, complicating training data and historical baselines.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We post a multi-level salary range for all of our roles.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is not inclusive of the rest of our awesome portfolio that includes equity compensation and world-class benefits.

    "job_description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.The Opportunity The U.S. healthcare system wastes hundreds of billions of dollars a year on administrative complexity—the friction between payers, providers, and the systems that connect them. We believe AI can materially reduce that waste, and we’re building the products to do it. We’re looking for someone to own this effort. As the product lead for Healthcare, you will be Anthropic’s healthcare leader—setting strategy, shipping products, and serving as the company’s voice in one of the most consequential industries AI will transform. You’ll work across product, engineering, research, go-to-market, policy, and safety to build a healthcare business from early momentum into a scaled vertical. This is a 0→1 role. It will be your job to take ownership, sharpen the plan, and drive execution. The scope is broad—healthcare touches nearly every function at the company—and you need to be the kind of person who thrives catching all the balls, triaging what matters, and making sure nothing important falls through the cracks. Low ego, high accountability. What You’ll Do Own Anthropic’s healthcare strategy end-to-end. You are the DRI, accountable for the plan, the priorities, and the results. Build and ship AI products that address high-value workflows across the payer, provider, and health tech ecosystem. Identify where the biggest pain is, define what to build, and drive it to market. Be Anthropic’s healthcare leader externally. When a customer, partner, regulator, government agency, or journalist wants to talk to Anthropic about healthcare, you take the meeting. You’re credible, prepared, and trusted. Triage and coordinate the many cross-functional threads that healthcare creates across the company—product, research, engineering, applied AI, sales, safety, policy, legal, and compliance. Find a home for everything and make sure it moves forward. Define the product and research roadmap in close partnership with engineering and research teams. You don’t need to lead research day-to-day, but you need sharp instincts about where the model falls short in healthcare contexts and the ability to work with the right teams to close those gaps. Drive regulatory readiness—including HIPAA compliance—across Anthropic’s products as they serve healthcare customers. Build relationships with strategic customers and partners. Translate what you learn from the market into product priorities, data partnerships, and go-to-market strategy. You May Be a Good Fit If You’ve spent meaningful time inside the healthcare industry. You’ve worked deeply with payers, providers, or health tech companies and you know how the system actually works: the regulations, the incentives, the operational realities, and where the real inefficiencies live. You have 10+ years of experience in healthcare, with a significant portion spent close to administrative workflows, revenue cycle, payer operations, or the technology that supports them. You’ve built products or businesses from scratch (0→1) in complex, regulated environments. You know what it takes to go from ambiguity to a shipped product with real customers. You have strong cross-functional instincts and genuine willingness to do the work. This role involves as much coordination, follow-through, and unglamorous problem-solving as it does strategy. You are not above any task. You have strong product judgment and enough technical fluency to engage meaningfully with engineers and researchers on tradeoffs—without needing to be the most technical person in the room. You know when the model isn’t good enough for a given use case and can articulate what “better” looks like. You communicate exceptionally well. You can translate between the languages of AI capabilities, healthcare operations, regulatory requirements, and business outcomes with equal comfort. You have experience navigating HIPAA, CMS regulations, or other healthcare compliance frameworks and understand what it takes to ship products in heavily regulated industries. Why This Role Healthcare is one of the largest and most important industries in the world, and it’s on the cusp of a generational technology shift. Anthropic is building the most capable and safety-focused AI in the industry, and this role puts you at the center of bringing that technology to the sector where it can do the most good. You’ll have the autonomy to define strategy, the mandate to ship products, and the backing of a world-class team across research, engineering, and go-to-market. If you’re the kind of person who wants to build something that matters—and has the healthcare expertise and entrepreneurial drive to actually pull it off—we want to hear from you.The annual compensation range for this role is listed below. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.Annual Salary:$485,000 - $645,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

This is a foundational role where you'll shape our strategy for deploying Claude for Life Sciences across domains of research including the biomedical sciences, chemistry, and materials science. You'll work with incredibly interdisciplinary partners from academia as well as early stage companies. Your goal will be to develop relationships and goal directed partnerships that demonstrate or expand the capabilities of Claude in the sciences. You will focus both on individual projects but also building communities of practice that bring together scientists with similar interests or objectives. The right person will combine deep relationships in sciences with an entrepreneurial and experimental drive to build something new at the frontier of AI. About Beneficial Deployments Beneficial Deployments ensures AI reaches and benefits the communities that need it most. We partner with nonprofits, foundations, and mission-driven organizations to deploy Claude in education, global health, economic mobility, and life sciences. We prioritize opportunities to make AI more accessible and raise the floor of what is possible in a given domain while also partnering with leaders to help expand the use of AI to new tasks that raise the ceiling of what is possible. Responsibilities: Own and execute Anthropic's AI for Science API credit strategy, managing partnerships with academic labs, small start-ups, and potentially foundations Identify, evaluate, and onboard new partners via our API credit application calls as well as targeted relationship building Serve as the primary relationship owner for AI for Science, coordinating with Anthropic’s Applied AI, product, and GTM teams to deliver impact Compile regular reports and learnings from the AI for Science ecosystem to help inform research and GTM priorities Manage timelines, resource requirements, and regular reporting associated with the AI for Science program Work closely with partners to understand their technical and operational needs and translate them into deployment plans Comfort with early technical prototyping and testing to help learn alongside and unblock partners Set a research agenda for understanding AI's impact on individual labs across domains Identify opportunities to create public goods -- open-source tools, datasets, and research -- that benefit the broader ecosystem Represent Anthropic at global scientific convenings and conferences Help shape team processes and culture as we scale our Life Science work You Might Be a Good Fit If You Have: 7+ years of experience in life sciences research with ample exposure to the intersection of new technologies as a catalyst for accelerating progress 3+ years of experience managing external partnerships, grantmaking, or multi-stakeholder initiatives Deep relationships and credibility in the life sciences domains: you are familiar with the key players at major universities, research institutes, and tools companies Technical fluency to engage credibly on AI concepts, understand LLM capabilities and limitations, and partner effectively with technical teams Analytical mindset with experience using data to inform strategy and measure impact Experience building communities of practice in which scientists from multiple domains converge on shared exploration and use of new technologies An entrepreneurial mindset: you've built programs or organizations from scratch, likely at startups or in founding roles A genuine drive to maximize impact for underserved communities High agency and comfort with ambiguity; you thrive when you're building the plane while flying it Strong prioritization skills and the ability to manage a high volume of partnerships and opportunities Willingness to travel for occasional partner visits and conferences Strong Candidates May Also Have: Experience working with philanthropic foundations on science funding Background at biotech companies, academic research institutions, funding, and roles at the intersection of scientific research and technology product Background in wet lab research with an ability and aptitude for scientific communications The annual compensation range for this role is listed below.

However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day.

At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco.
