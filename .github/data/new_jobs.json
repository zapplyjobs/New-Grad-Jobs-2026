    "job_description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.Anthropic’s Audio team pushes the boundaries of what's possible with audio with large language models. We care about making safe, steerable, reliable systems that can understand and generate speech and audio, prioritizing not only naturalness but also steerability and robustness. As a researcher on the Audio team, you'll work across the full stack of audio ML, developing audio codecs and representations, sourcing and synthesizing high quality audio data, training large-scale speech language models and large audio diffusion models, and developing novel architectures for incorporating continuous signals into LLMs. Our team focuses primarily but not exclusively on speech, building advanced steerable systems spanning end-to-end conversational systems, speech and audio understanding models, and speech synthesis capabilities. The team works closely with many collaborators across pretraining, finetuning, reinforcement learning, production inference, and product to get advanced audio technologies from early research to high impact real-world deployments. You may be a good fit if you: Have hands-on experience with training audio models, whether that's conversational speech-to-speech, speech translation, speech recognition, text-to-speech, diarization, codecs, or generative audio models Genuinely enjoy both research and engineering work, and you'd describe your ideal split as roughly 50/50 rather than heavily weighted toward one or the other Are comfortable working across abstraction levels, from signal processing fundamentals to large-scale model training and inference optimization Have deep expertise with JAX, PyTorch, or large-scale distributed training, and can debug performance issues across the full stack Thrive in fast-moving environments where the most important problem might shift as we learn more about what works Communicate clearly and collaborate effectively; audio touches many parts of our systems, so you'll work closely with teams across the company Are passionate about building conversational AI that feels natural, steerable, and safe Care about the societal impacts of voice AI and want to help shape how these systems are developed responsibly Strong candidates may also have experience with: Large language model pretraining and finetuning Training diffusion models for image and audio generation Reinforcement learning for large language models and diffusion models End-to-end system optimization, from performance benchmarking to kernel optimization GPUs, Kubernetes, PyTorch, or distributed training infrastructure Representative projects: Training state-of-the art neural audio codecs for 48 kHz stereo audio Developing novel algorithms for diffusion pretraining and reinforcement learning Scaling audio datasets to millions of hours of high quality audio Creating robust evaluation methodologies for hard-to-measure qualities such as naturalness or expressiveness Studying training dynamics of mixed audio-text language models Optimizing latency and inference throughput for deployed streaming audio systems The annual compensation range for this role is listed below. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.Annual Salary:$350,000 - $500,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

    "job_description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the role We're building the infrastructure that enables Claude to act in the world—booking travel, writing code, calling APIs, managing files, and completing multi-step tasks autonomously. This is foundational work for the next generation of AI capabilities. The Agent Infrastructure team designs and operates the execution environments, state management systems, and security boundaries that make autonomous AI agents safe and reliable. You'll work at the intersection of distributed systems, security engineering, and product—building systems that don't exist anywhere else in industry. This is a high-priority initiative. The problems are hard, the scope is greenfield, and the impact is immediate. What you'll do: Design and build sandboxed compute environments where Claude can safely execute code, access tools, and interact with external services Build state management systems for long-running agent tasks—handling checkpoints, recovery, and resumption across failures Develop authentication and authorization frameworks for delegated access—enabling Claude to act on behalf of users securely Create observability and debugging tools for agent execution—understanding what Claude did, why, and how to make it better Partner closely with product and research teams to define what's possible and ship it You may be a good fit if you: Have 6+ years of experience building distributed systems, infrastructure, or platform services at the hyper scale Comfortable building Cloud Native infrastructure on GCP, AWS, or Azure Care deeply about security, isolation, and building systems that fail safely Have experience with containers, sandboxing, or secure execution environments (e.g., gVisor, Firecracker, V8 isolates) Are comfortable with ambiguity—this is greenfield work, and you'll help define the architecture Write clean, maintainable code in Python, Go, Rust, or similar Want to work on problems that don't have existing playbooks Strong candidates may have: Experience building multi-tenant execution platforms or serverless infrastructure Background in security engineering, sandboxing, or isolation technologies Familiarity with workflow orchestration systems (Temporal, Airflow, Step Functions) Experience with state machines, checkpointing, or durable execution patterns Low-level systems experience (Linux internals, eBPF, container runtimes) The annual compensation range for this role is listed below. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.Annual Salary:$320,000 - $485,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

You&#39;ll work at the intersection of distributed systems, security engineering, and product—building systems that don&#39;t exist anywhere else in industry.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a high-priority initiative. The problems are hard, the scope is greenfield, and the impact is immediate.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you&#39;ll do:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Design and build sandboxed compute environments where Claude can safely execute code, access tools, and interact with external services&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build state management systems for long-running agent tasks—handling checkpoints, recovery, and resumption across failures&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Develop authentication and authorization frameworks for delegated access—enabling Claude to act on behalf of users securely&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Create observability and debugging tools for agent execution—understanding what Claude did, why, and how to make it better&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Partner closely with product and research teams to define what&#39;s possible and ship it&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You may be a good fit if you:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have 6+ years of experience building distributed systems, infrastructure, or platform services at the hyper scale&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Comfortable building Cloud Native infrastructure on GCP, AWS, or Azure&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Care deeply about security, isolation, and building systems that fail safely&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have experience with containers, sandboxing, or secure execution environments (e.g., gVisor, Firecracker, V8 isolates)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are comfortable with ambiguity—this is greenfield work, and you&#39;ll help define the architecture&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Write clean, maintainable code in Python, Go, Rust, or similar&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Want to work on problems that don&#39;t have existing playbooks&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong candidates may have:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience building multi-tenant execution platforms or serverless infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Background in security engineering, sandboxing, or isolation technologies&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with workflow orchestration systems (Temporal, Airflow, Step Functions)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience with state machines, checkpointing, or durable execution patterns&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Low-level systems experience (Linux internals, eBPF, container runtimes)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The annual compensation range for this role is listed below.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (&quot;OTE&quot;) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Annual Salary:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-range&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$320,000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;divider&quot;&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;$485,000 USD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logistics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education requirements: &lt;/strong&gt;We require at least a Bachelor&#39;s degree in a related field or equivalent experience.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Location-based hybrid policy:&lt;/strong&gt; Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time.

If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

    "description": "&lt;div class=&quot;content-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Anthropic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is seeking talented and experienced Software Engineers to join our Builds team within the Developer Platform organization. The Builds team owns the build infrastructure that every engineer and researcher at Anthropic depends on—from hermetic build environments and container image pipelines to remote build execution, build caching, and dependency management across our monorepo. By joining this team, you&#39;ll have a direct impact on the velocity and reliability of Anthropic&#39;s research and product development.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As Anthropic scales its engineering organization, research ambitions, and the volume of code contributed by both humans and AI agents, build infrastructure is becoming a critical bottleneck and a critical lever. We&#39;re building next-generation systems—scalable remote build execution with content-addressable storage, fine-grained incremental builds, and hermetic reproducible environments—to ensure that build times shrink even as the codebase grows by orders of magnitude.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our monorepo spans Python, Rust, and Go, with builds targeting multiple accelerator platforms (TPUs, Trainium, GPUs) and complex SDK dependencies. This creates uniquely challenging problems in hermeticity, caching, cross-language interop, and dependency management that few organizations encounter. If you&#39;ve built or operated large-scale, hermetic build infrastructure at a company with a large monorepo and are excited about designing systems that keep thousands of engineers productive, this is the role for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Design and build scalable, hermetic build infrastructure including remote build execution (RBE) and content-addressable storage (CAS) systems that support all source and image builds&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Own and evolve Nix-based build environments and package management, keeping nixpkgs and language runtimes current and compatible&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Drive fine-grained dependency management across the monorepo to enable incremental builds and eliminate unnecessary rebuilds&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build and maintain language-specific build toolchains and accelerator SDK/runtime builds&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Reduce container image build times through architectural improvements to build pipelines, layer caching, and content-addressable storage&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Partner with CI, Languages, and Developer Acceleration teams to ensure build infrastructure integrates seamlessly with the broader developer platform&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You May Be a Good Fit If You:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have 6+ years of relevant industry experience building and operating large-scale build systems and infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have deep experience with hermetic, reproducible build systems (Bazel, Buck, Nix, or similar) in a large monorepo environment&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Understand build caching strategies, remote execution, and content-addressable storage deeply&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have experience with containerized build environments and image build pipelines&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have strong proficiency in at least one of Python, Rust, or Go&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have excellent communication skills and enjoy supporting internal partners to improve their development experience&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are excited about designing foundational systems and are comfortable working independently on ambiguous, high-impact technical challenges&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong Candidates May Also Have:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience with Nix/NixOS and managing large Nix package sets at scale&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience with Rust build toolchains (cargo, maturin) and Python-Rust interop&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience building or operating remote build execution systems (Bazel Remote Execution API, BuildBarn, BuildBuddy, or similar)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience managing accelerator SDK builds (CUDA, Neuron SDK, JAX/XLA)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience with fine-grained dependency graph analysis and incremental build optimization at monorepo scale&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deadline to apply:&lt;/strong&gt; None.
