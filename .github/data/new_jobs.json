But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us.

How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

Working at Subsplash is more than just a job; we are a team of people who are courageous, inventive, and passionate about doing meaningful work every day. Don’t take our word for it—head to Glassdoor and see for yourself! About the Team The Subsplash Product & Engineering Team is responsible for all products that the company develops including the App Platform and Merchant Services. We are a team of designers, developers, and coordinators, creating polished experiences for our clients and end users. The P&E Team is responsible for the entire user experience including: End-User Mobile Apps, the Subsplash Dashboard (our Content Management System), Subsplash Giving (Our Donation and Merchant Services Platform), Media services, the Web App, backend data feeds, analytics, and more. The Product Team supports our Clients by providing a unified set of tools to help reduce administrative overhead so Clients can focus on their core mission and expand their reach. About the Role As a Software Development Engineer I (Front-End), you will report to the Software Development Manager. You will work closely with your scrum team to build out innovative software systems that enhance the capabilities of Subsplash for our clients. As part of the scrum team you will work hard to achieve sprint commitments on time. You will be called upon to give estimates of assigned work, and you should feel comfortable with accurately estimating any size of project. As part of the self organizing scrum team you should feel comfortable working independently, and be able to stay focused on committed tasks for the duration of a sprint. As part of the Client-Side development team you will be expected to deliver world-class web experiences across all of the Subsplash products. Additionally, part of being on the Client-Side team means giving feedback on code reviews, as well as accepting critical feedback on your own code. You’ll be expected to write and review documentation, API docs, and code. You should also feel comfortable working with Designers, Product owners/stakeholders, and scrum masters, and offering constructive feedback when necessary. You are expected to understand how to read and understand OpenAPI documentation, and build front-end systems to interact with the Subsplash backend systems. You are a high performing member of the team that loves to work in various Javascript frameworks such as React and Ember, but also has a deep understanding of front-end languages such as Typescript. You will also be called upon to work within our mobile app codebases. You are an excellent communicator and are able to effectively coach and mentor other members on the team. Team members are expected to take security, scalability and uptime of our software systems seriously. It’s expected of you that you will take reasonable precautions to help ensure the software systems at Subsplash are performing at their best, and without defects. Your Priorities Write and maintain quality software Implement well-structured, maintainable client-side code under the guidance of more senior engineers. Build features and fix bugs in front-end applications using TypeScript (EmberJS, React) and other front-end technologies. Learn and apply basic mobile development concepts (React Native, iOS, Android) as needed for your team’s work. Participate actively in code reviews: Incorporate feedback into your own work. Ask clarifying questions to deepen your understanding of best practices. Document your work clearly (comments, simple API docs, and basic wiki pages) so others can understand how your code works and how to use it. Follow established architectural patterns and guidelines when implementing features, asking for help when requirements or designs are unclear. Use existing client-side component libraries and patterns, and help identify opportunities to reuse rather than rewrite components. Learn from others and support your team Seek mentorship from more experienced engineers, being open to feedback and coaching. Ask questions early and often to unblock yourself and ensure you’re building the right thing. Share what you learn with teammates (for example, via small demos, documentation updates, or answering questions from peers at a similar level). Demonstrate humility and collaboration: Listen to others’ ideas. Be willing to change your approach based on new information or feedback. Be an effective Scrum team member Provide honest estimates for your own tasks and update your team when estimates need to change. Break down your work into manageable steps with help from more senior engineers when needed. Communicate clearly about your progress and blockers so the team can help you stay on track with sprint commitments. Write tests and follow team quality practices (linting, code style, basic automated testing) to keep defects low. Balance the desire to move quickly with the need to produce reliable, maintainable code, deferring to senior guidance when tradeoffs are unclear. Contribute to innovation and continuous improvement Bring forward ideas for small improvements to the user experience, performance, or developer workflow. Participate in experiments, spikes, and proof-of-concepts led by more experienced engineers, helping to implement and evaluate new approaches. Suggest documentation or tooling improvements when you notice friction in your day-to-day work. Take initiative in small ways—such as cleaning up code you touch, improving comments, or updating a wiki page—without waiting to be asked.
