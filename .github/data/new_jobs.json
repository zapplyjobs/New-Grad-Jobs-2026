Experiments such as the Askaryan Radio Array (ARA) and the future radio component of IceCube-Gen2 at the South Pole and the Radio Neutrino Observatory in Greenland (RNO-G) search for EeV-scale neutrinos with antennas deployed in polar ice. Balloon-borne experiments like the Payload for Ultra-high-Energy Observations (PUEO) search for neutrino interactions in the ice and upgoing tau neutrinos from a high altitude. Researchers in the Wissel lab are also exploring novel concepts like the Beamforming Elevated Array for Cosmic Neutrinos which searches for upgoing tau neutrinos from a high-elevation mountain. Previous experience in these experiments or related experiments is advantageous, but not required.  The postdoctoral scholar will conduct research on PUEO, which is expected to launch from McMurdo in 2024. For PUEO, the Penn State group is responsible for a deployable array of antenna and calibration systems. The payload will be integrated in Chicago and in Palestine, Tx prior to launch and the postdoc will be expected to contribute to building and testing instrumentation on the PUEO instrument. They will also travel to contribute to integration activities and  may conduct field work in Antarctica. As a member of the PUEO team, they will contribute to searches for the highest energy neutrinos in the flight data.Penn State is a vibrant and stimulating environment for particle and multi-messenger astrophysics with ample opportunities for collaboration and career development. The postdoctoral scholar will be embedded within the Particle Astrophysics group and the Center for Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (CMA) at the Institute for Gravitation and the Cosmos (IGC). Penn State is a leading institution in multi-messenger astrophysics. PSU hosts the Astrophysical Multi-Messenger Observatory Network, strong experimental groups in LIGO, HAWC, Auger, HELIX, LZ, Project8, IceCube, GRAND, and Swift, as well as leading theoretical groups in particle astrophysics, gravitation, and cosmology. Education and ExperienceApplications will be considered from Ph.D. physicists and astronomers with strong backgrounds in particle astrophysics, multi-messenger astrophysics, particle physics, cosmic ray physics,  and related fields. Additional InformationApplications must be submitted electronically and include a CV and brief statement of research interests. Applicants should arrange for three reference letters to be submitted to physicsapply@psu.edu indicating the appropriate job number in the subject line. This is a term appointment funded for one year from date of hire, with possibility of yearly renewal.

Our Terran R vehicle will deliver customer payloads to orbit, meeting the growing demand for launch capacity. But that’s just the start. Achieving commercial success with Terran R will unlock new opportunities to advance science, exploration, and innovation, pioneering progress that reaches beyond the known. Joining Relativity means becoming part of something where autonomy, ownership, and impact exist at every level. Here, you're not just executing tasks; you're solving problems that haven’t been solved before, helping develop a rocket, a factory, and a business from the ground up. Whether you’re in propulsion, manufacturing, software, avionics, or a corporate function, you’ll collaborate across teams, shape decisions, and see your work come to life in record time. Relativity is a place where creativity and technical rigor go hand in hand, and your voice will help define the stories we’re writing together. Now is a unique moment in time where it’s early enough to leave your mark on the product, the process, and the culture, but far enough along that Terran R is tangible and picking up momentum. The most meaningful work of your career is waiting.
