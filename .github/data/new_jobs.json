    "job_description": "Why Shiftsmart We’re building the Amazon of labor. We’re a labor platform pairing end-to-end workforce management technology with a rapidly growing global network of 5M flexible workers to create scalable labor solutions for the largest companies and government agencies in the world like Circle K, Pepsi, Walmart, Starbucks and more. Our unique business model fractionalizes jobs down to shifts and makes it easy for workers to work across multiple companies through a digital marketplace. We’re one of the fastest-growing startups in the country. We’ve grown 2-3x each year since we started, paid over $130M in wages to hourly workers, and raised $120M+ from top-tier investors including D1 Capital &amp; Imaginary Ventures… and we’re only getting started. We're transforming the labor industry Who you are The Engineering Team enables Shiftsmart to anticipate and creatively solve problems across multiple functions with solutions that have a lasting impact for both our customers (employers) and our users (workers). Our mission is simple: To build the world’s leading platform for hourly workers and enterprises enabling flexibility, choice, and upward social mobility. We're looking for early career software engineers to join our growing team in New York. This role is based in New York City (HQ) with typically 4+ days per week in the office. Outcomes: The problems you’ll help solve As a valuable member of our growing engineering team, you will: Collaborate on technical projects across the stack — from brainstorming and design to development and deployment. Example projects include improving the onboarding experience to boost worker sign-ups or supporting dispatch system optimizations to increase shift fill rates. Contribute to building reliable and scalable features, tools, and services using technologies like Node.js, React/React Native, MongoDB, Python, and GCP. Write clean, maintainable code and participate in code reviews to improve code quality and learn best practices. Help monitor and troubleshoot production systems to ensure stability and performance in a high-traffic, two-sided marketplace. Grow with mentorship and support , gaining exposure to technical decision-making, architecture discussions, and opportunities to take ownership of smaller features or systems over time. Competencies: Who you are You have a working knowledge of our tech stack — such as Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Node.js, and React/React Native — and you're eager to learn more every day. Early in your engineering journey : You have 0–3 years of hands-on experience building software (internships, projects, or full-time roles) and a desire to continuously improve. Team player : You enjoy working with product managers, designers, and fellow engineers, and are open to feedback and collaboration across the team. Motivated by outcomes : You want to understand the “why” behind your work and how it contributes to real-world results for users and the business. Problem solver at heart : You’re proactive, curious, and excited by the idea of working in a fast-paced, startup environment where ambiguity is part of the challenge. Startup-ready : You’re eager to roll up your sleeves, learn quickly, and contribute to a mission-driven team doing meaningful work. Compensation philosophy To provide greater transparency we share base salary ranges, which are based on role and level benchmarked against similar stage, high growth companies. Offers are determined based on multiple factors including skills, work experience, and relevant credentials. In addition to competitive salaries and meaningful equity we offer the following benefits: Comprehensive healthcare coverage: We cover 100% of employee premiums for medical, dental, and vision care (60-75% for dependents) 401(k) match program: We match 100% on the first 3% of your contributions and 50% on the next 2% for a maximum match of 4% Generous, fully paid parental and family leave policies Pre-tax commuter benefits Collaborative office with fully stocked kitchen @ 1 World Trade in Manhattan Equal opportunity employer Shiftsmart is committed to creating a diverse environment and is proud to be an equal-opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status. Operating Principles @ Shiftsmart Inspired by Leadership Principles @ Amazon Execution Is Binary We #GetShiftDone. We take immense pride in both the quality of our work and our relentless determination to deliver on our commitments. If we say we are going to do something, we do it. We own the outcome with an unstoppable mindset through the finish line and are impatient to move the ball forward. This means we work really hard, execute with urgency, and ruthlessly challenge timelines for anything important. As a result, we do not defer responsibility to other teams or individuals. Instead, we take the problem as far as we can and only when needed ask others for help. Each time a crisis or opportunity emerges we take the hill as one team, because we are allergic to the words “it can’t be done” . Missionaries, Not Mercenaries We before me. We believe in our mission to build a better world for workers. We understand why our work matters and take seriously how it impacts our customers and our partners. This belief permeates everything we do from the strategic to the mundane. We are energetic, ambitious, and want to win. We constantly raise the standards for ourselves and everyone around us. We show up for our customers, our partners, and most importantly our teammates, and make every effort to build lasting relationships with each of them. We do not measure success based on our titles or the size of our empires. This also means we put the needs of the business before the details of our job descriptions. Rather than fight for a bigger piece of the pie, we fight to grow the entire thing and recognize this is how to grow our careers too. Inputs &gt; Outcomes We work really hard. Fundamentally changing how labor works is not easy. It often requires long days, late nights, and weekends to deliver on our commitments. We lean into this challenge. We focus on the process. We think in terms of value chains and appreciate that a bad process with a good outcome is simply dumb luck. We lead with data. We use facts, not fiction, to build narratives and make decisions. To do this we prepare written memos in advance and resist the urge to engage in endless water cooler what ifs, because we value the time and attention of our teammates. We hire and develop the best. When we decide to hire a new team member, we do so because we believe they will increase the talent density on our team. We view ourselves as leverage maximizers rather than inconvenience reducers and strive to increase the output of everyone we interact with. Honesty Over Harmony We share the truth even when it is painful. We do not, however, share the truth callously to hurt people’s feelings or make them look bad. We also assume positive intent. If someone is not delivering in a way that we need, we ask them and tell them before assuming the worst. We embrace mutual feedback. As people leaders we care more about our team’s growth and success than how much others like us. As individuals we seek, accept, and apply feedback. We do not give or take feedback personally because we understand it enables us to learn and grow. We tell the truth to ourselves. We reject a pollyannaish view of our world. Instead if something isn’t going well that we are responsible for, we call it out. And when someone calls out their own truth that may be less optimal, we don’t punish them for it. We have the meeting in the meeting. If something is broken or we disagree, we call it out and say something in the moment even if it feels uncomfortable to do so. This means that if something is broken, we do not just accept it and complain later. Invent &amp; Iterate We are inventors @ heart. We categorically reject the phrase “that is how it’s always been done” , and constantly discover new and better ways to do more with less. This means we are resourceful and often do things that don’t scale, only to create ways to scale them later. We’re builders. We think BIG. At every level of the company, we embrace big, hairy, audacious, and transformative goals. We fear lack of progress and incremental thinking more than failing to deliver or falling short of an audacious goal. We believe courage means to try without fear and learn without ego. We do not let perfect get in the way of better. When faced with the choice we prioritize delivering something, even if imperfect, over endless debate and alignment. We embrace good mistakes.",

    "job_description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.About the role: We are looking for backend / platform software engineers to join our Product Foundations org. We build foundational primitives that help accelerate product development across Anthropic. Some examples of what we own and maintain are our core sampling pipeline, our rate limiting platform, and our RAG platform. We have multiple teams that are currently hiring. Team placement occurs after the interview process, taking into account your interests and experience alongside organizational needs. This flexible approach allows us to match talented engineers with the platform efforts where they'll have the greatest impact and growth potential: Product Dev Product: We work on maximizing the developer productivity of product engineers at Anthropic. You'll architect and optimize the critical development infrastructure that powers our AI product development, including dev environments, developer tooling, and CI/CD pipelines. You’ll partner closely with product teams to understand their development workflow and eliminate friction points. Your work will have an extraordinary multiplier effect, enhancing productivity across our entire product organization and accelerating our mission. Product Platform: We provide a set of stable, powerful, and easy to use shared product capabilities leveraged by the Claude.ai, API and other internal product and research teams. You’ll work on our core platform components like rate limiting, LLM sampling and multimodal processing. Our mandate includes developing reusable components, improving system performance, and creating scalable abstractions that accelerate product development across the organization while maintaining high standards for reliability and security. Accounts Platform: We build and maintain the critical infrastructure that powers identity and authentication across Anthropic's product suite. We work closely with product teams, security, support, and trust & safety as customers. We create scalable solutions for user authentication, authorization, role-based access control, and single sign-on that form the backbone of our company's identity management operations. We maintain a user-centric approach, building reliable systems that our users and company can depend on as we tackle complex challenges at the intersection of security, scalability, and user experience. Billing Platform: We build and maintain the core billing platform that powers all of Anthropic’s products. You will lead the design and implementation of our billing infrastructure, working at the intersection of our core product, financial systems, and customer-facing features. This role is crucial for scaling our revenue operations, ensuring a seamless customer experience and enables the launch of new and innovative products with complex billing requirements. Claude Execution: We build the infrastructure that enables Claude to safely interact with the outside world through the use of tools. Our team owns the platform that provides secure, isolated execution environments as well as the infrastructure that connects Claude to external services via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). You'll work on challenging problems at the intersection of security and capability: designing sandboxes that are both secure and performant, building reliable MCP infrastructure, and expanding our platform for enterprise deployments. We collaborate closely with product teams across Claude.ai, API, and Claude Code to deliver the execution capabilities that make Claude genuinely useful for real-world tasks. Relevant experience includes containerization, secure execution environments, and developing for enterprise requirements. Responsibilities: Build and scale platform components to handle Anthropic’s rapid growth Design and architect platform components that are composable and deliver value for a variety of use cases Collaborate closely with product teams to understand their needs and build platform capabilities that accelerate their feature delivery Make build vs buy decisions, evaluating and implementing 3rd party solutions when most impactful Set technical direction and vision for various product and platform features Partner with research to quickly prototype and launch new capabilities based on research breakthroughs You might be a good fit if you: Have 6+ years of practical experience as a backend or platform engineer building scalable distributed systems Have strong coding skills and experience with service-oriented architectures Have worked in early start-up or otherwise fast moving, rapidly evolving environments, and have ideally built products from 0 to 1 Take full ownership of your work, navigate ambiguity effectively, and proactively overcome obstacles to deliver results Are comfortable diving into any part of the system, whether it's infrastructure, services, or product frontends, to deliver effective solutions Enjoy working with a fast-paced team tackling cutting-edge problems in AI safety and conversational AI Take a product-focused approach and care about building solutions that are robust, scalable, and easy to use Enjoy pair programming (we love to pair!) Have a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Software Engineering or comparable experience Strong candidates may also: Have worked with NLP and ML models and understand their capabilities and limitations Have experience with REST APIs Have experience with React and Frontend frameworks The expected base compensation for this position is below. Our total compensation package for full-time employees includes equity, benefits, and may include incentive compensation.Annual Salary:$320,000 - $405,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.
