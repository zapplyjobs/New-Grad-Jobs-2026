Today, enterprises spend $120T+ per year globally (&gt;30 times larger than annual consumer e-commerce spend) and rely on vendors more than ever before to run their businesses. Our cofounders started Zip in 2020 to address this seemingly intractable problem with a purpose-built procurement platform that provides a simple, consumer-grade user experience. Within the last 4 years, Zip has created a new category and developed the leading solution in this $50B+ TAM space.

You will Design and build product features for enterprise customers, such as AI-powered anomaly detection for payment fraud and account takeovers, granular access control and identity management, and bring-your-own-key encryption. Work closely with cross-functional product and customer-facing teams to understand requirements and ship thoughtful solutions. Work closely with our customers’ security teams (e.g., Discover, Snowflake, and Anthropic) to understand their needs and learn how they assess risk. Build guardrails, tooling, frameworks, and automation to empower software engineers to ship secure changes and prevent vulnerabilities from reaching the main branch. Design and build scalable frontend applications and components. Qualifications Minimum 1+ years of experience in a software engineering role. This role requires software development experience. Experience with web application and API development in production environments. At Zip, our stack includes Python, Typescript, React, and GraphQL.
