Our platform ingests high-rate telemetry, validates complex autonomy software in real time, and helps engineering teams iterate faster without sacrificing safety or precision. We’re a small, fast-moving team of engineers and operators who own problems end-to-end, work across disciplines, and thrive on solving challenges at the intersection of hardware and software. As a dual-use platform, we're serving top-tier commercial and defense customers, including the U.S. Navy, United States Air Force, Shield AI, and Anduril.We’re backed by top-tier investors — Sequoia, General Catalyst, Founders Fund, Lux Capital, and Lightspeed Ventures — who share our mission to accelerate innovation in mission-critical systems. Our team brings experience from SpaceX, Palantir, Anduril, Applied Intuition, and other leading companies, united by a common goal: enabling hardware engineers to push the boundaries of advanced technology with speed, safety, and precision.In this pivotal role, you’ll deliver Nominal’s vision of providing continuous testing to the industrial base, equipping engineers to deploy capability at scale, in the shortest time possible.

You find a way forward – even when the playbook doesn’t exist yet. You are a hustler who moves quickly, gets a LOT done, and maintains a consistent bar for excellence.Resilient and persistent: You don’t get discouraged by a “no” and instead use that as fuel to be even more creative. You’re comfortable with repetition and iterating until you land the right message.Strong communication instincts: You can adapt your communication to different audiences – internal and external. You write clearly, ask good questions, and make crisp recommendations. You can draft and adapt outbound for technical engineers or c-suite executives. You can coordinate between sales and marketing orgs to refine our messaging & report on what’s resonating.A builder’s mindset: You want to help build the machine, not just run it.
