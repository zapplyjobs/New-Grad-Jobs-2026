    "job_description": "Snapshot This role is for a Research Engineer focusing on Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) AI Responsibility at Google DeepMind. The role involves developing, implementing, and maintaining evaluations and mitigations, and the infrastructure that supports them. About us Artificial Intelligence could be one of humanity’s most useful inventions. At Google DeepMind, we’re a team of scientists, engineers, machine learning experts and more, working together to advance the state of the art in artificial intelligence. We use our technologies for widespread public benefit and scientific discovery, and collaborate with others on critical challenges, ensuring safety and ethics are the highest priority. The role As we develop models with strong capabilities in the physical sciences, we are looking for Research Engineers to make sure these capabilities are always put to good use. Using your knowledge of machine learning and science, you will help design new evaluations for CBRN risk, communicate the results clearly, and ensure the safety of our AI systems. You will work closely with other Engineers and Research Scientists as well as with experts in AI ethics and policy. Key responsibilities Design and develop robust evaluations to test potential CBRN risks arising from cutting-edge AI models with strong capabilities in the physical sciences. Develop and maintain infrastructure for these evaluations. Run these evaluations prior to releases for new AI models. Resolve potential CBRN risks with state-of-the-art mitigations. Clearly communicate results to decision-makers. Collaborate with subject matter experts in CBRN, AI policy and ethics, model development, and scientific research. Develop and maintain an understanding of trends in AI development, CBRN threat landscapes, governance, and relevant sociotechnical research to inform the design of new evaluations. About you In order to set you up for success as a Research Engineer at Google DeepMind, we look for the following skills and experience: Bachelor's degree in a technical subject (e.g., computer science, engineering, machine learning, mathematics, physics, statistics) or a relevant scientific field with strong computational experience (e.g., bioinformatics, computational chemistry, biotechnology, computational materials science), or equivalent practical experience. Proven ability to write clean, maintainable, and efficient Python. Knowledge of concepts in mathematics, statistics, and machine learning needed for understanding cutting-edge research in AI, CBRN-related modeling, and risk assessment. Ability to present and explain technical results clearly to non-experts and leadership stakeholders. In addition, the following would be an advantage: Master's or PhD in a field relevant to CBRN risk assessment or AI safety, such as chemical, biological, or nuclear engineering. Experience in CBRN threat analysis, risk assessment, modeling, or mitigation strategies. Familiarity with relevant datasets, benchmarks, or evaluation methodologies for CBRN risks in AI. Experience developing or working with safety-critical systems. Experience with data analysis tools and libraries for large-scale evaluation. Skill and interest in working on projects with many stakeholders, including scientific experts, policy teams, and engineers. Knowledge of international and national regulations or guidelines related to CBRN materials or technologies. The US base salary range for this full-time position is between $166,000 - $244,000+ bonus + equity + benefits. Your recruiter can share more about the specific salary range for your targeted location during the hiring process. Application deadline: 6pm PT Friday 31st October 2025 Note: In the event your application is successful and an offer of employment is made to you, any offer of employment will be conditional on the results of a background check, performed by a third party acting on our behalf. For more information on how we handle your data, please see our Applicant and Candidate Privacy Policy. At Google DeepMind, we value diversity of experience, knowledge, backgrounds and perspectives and harness these qualities to create extraordinary impact. We are committed to equal employment opportunities regardless of sex, race, religion or belief, ethnic or national origin, disability, age, citizenship, marital, domestic or civil partnership status, sexual orientation, gender identity, pregnancy, or related condition (including breastfeeding) or any other basis as protected by applicable law.
