Experiments such as the Askaryan Radio Array (ARA) and the future radio component of IceCube-Gen2 at the South Pole and the Radio Neutrino Observatory in Greenland (RNO-G) search for EeV-scale neutrinos with antennas deployed in polar ice. Balloon-borne experiments like the Payload for Ultra-high-Energy Observations (PUEO) search for neutrino interactions in the ice and upgoing tau neutrinos from a high altitude. Researchers in the Wissel lab are also exploring novel concepts like the Beamforming Elevated Array for COsmic Neutrinos which searches for upgoing tau neutrinos from a high-elevation mountain. Previous experience in these experiments or related experiments is advantageous, but not required.  The postdoctoral scholar will conduct research on RNO-G, which is under rapid expansion to cover a full 40 km^2. For RNO-G, the Penn State group is responsible for integration, testing, and validation of the data acquisitions systems and contributes to event filtering, both at the hardware and software level. As a part of the RNO-G team, they will contribute to searches for the highest energy neutrinos in the the data as well as instrument calibration and monitoring. The successful candidate may contribute to field deployment, installing and commissioning new stations for the experiment.Penn State is a vibrant and stimulating environment for particle and multi-messenger astrophysics with ample opportunities for collaboration and career development. The postdoctoral scholar will be embedded within the Particle Astrophysics group and the  Center for Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (CMA) at the Institute for Gravitation and the Cosmos (IGC). Penn State is a leading institution in multi-messenger astrophysics. PSU hosts the Astrophysical Multi-Messenger Observatory Network, strong experimental groups in LIGO, HAWC, Auger, HELIX, LZ, Project8, IceCube, GRAND, and Swift, as well as leading theoretical groups in particle astrophysics, gravitation, and cosmology. Education and ExperienceApplications will be considered from Ph.D. physicists and astronomers with strong backgrounds in particle astrophysics, multi-messenger astrophysics, particle physics, cosmic ray physics,  and related fields. Additional InformationApplications must be submitted electronically and include a CV and brief statement of research interests. Applicants should arrange for three reference letters to be submitted to physicsapply@psu.edu indicating the appropriate job number in the subject line. This is a term appointment funded for one year from date of hire, with possibility of yearly renewal.
