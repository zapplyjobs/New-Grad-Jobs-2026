    "job_description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.Anthropic’s Audio team pushes the boundaries of what's possible with audio with large language models. We care about making safe, steerable, reliable systems that can understand and generate speech and audio, prioritizing not only naturalness but also steerability and robustness. As a researcher on the Audio team, you'll work across the full stack of audio ML, developing audio codecs and representations, sourcing and synthesizing high quality audio data, training large-scale speech language models and large audio diffusion models, and developing novel architectures for incorporating continuous signals into LLMs. Our team focuses primarily but not exclusively on speech, building advanced steerable systems spanning end-to-end conversational systems, speech and audio understanding models, and speech synthesis capabilities. The team works closely with many collaborators across pretraining, finetuning, reinforcement learning, production inference, and product to get advanced audio technologies from early research to high impact real-world deployments. You may be a good fit if you: Have hands-on experience with training audio models, whether that's conversational speech-to-speech, speech translation, speech recognition, text-to-speech, diarization, codecs, or generative audio models Genuinely enjoy both research and engineering work, and you'd describe your ideal split as roughly 50/50 rather than heavily weighted toward one or the other Are comfortable working across abstraction levels, from signal processing fundamentals to large-scale model training and inference optimization Have deep expertise with JAX, PyTorch, or large-scale distributed training, and can debug performance issues across the full stack Thrive in fast-moving environments where the most important problem might shift as we learn more about what works Communicate clearly and collaborate effectively; audio touches many parts of our systems, so you'll work closely with teams across the company Are passionate about building conversational AI that feels natural, steerable, and safe Care about the societal impacts of voice AI and want to help shape how these systems are developed responsibly Strong candidates may also have experience with: Large language model pretraining and finetuning Training diffusion models for image and audio generation Reinforcement learning for large language models and diffusion models End-to-end system optimization, from performance benchmarking to kernel optimization GPUs, Kubernetes, PyTorch, or distributed training infrastructure Representative projects: Training state-of-the art neural audio codecs for 48 kHz stereo audio Developing novel algorithms for diffusion pretraining and reinforcement learning Scaling audio datasets to millions of hours of high quality audio Creating robust evaluation methodologies for hard-to-measure qualities such as naturalness or expressiveness Studying training dynamics of mixed audio-text language models Optimizing latency and inference throughput for deployed streaming audio systems The annual compensation range for this role is listed below. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.Annual Salary:$350,000 - $500,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

    "job_description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.Note: we don't have open Research Manager positions on the Interpretability team at this time. However, we're actively growing our team of Research Engineers and Research Scientists. If you're excited about interpretability research and open to an individual contributor role, we encourage you to apply. About the Interpretability team: When you see what modern language models are capable of, do you wonder, \"How do these things work? How can we trust them?\" The Interpretability team’s mission is to reverse engineer how trained models work, and Interpretability research is one of Anthropic’s core research bets on AI safety. We believe that a mechanistic understanding is the most robust way to make advanced systems safe. People mean many different things by \"interpretability\". We're focused on mechanistic interpretability, which aims to discover how neural network parameters map to meaningful algorithms. Some useful analogies might be to think of us as trying to do \"biology\" or \"neuroscience\" of neural networks, or as treating neural networks as binary computer programs we're trying to \"reverse engineer\". We aim to create a solid scientific foundation for mechanistically understanding neural networks and making them safe (see our vision post). We have focused on resolving the issue of \"superposition\" (see Toy Models of Superposition, Superposition, Memorization, and Double Descent, and our May 2023 update), which causes the computational units of the models, like neurons and attention heads, to be individually uninterpretable, and on finding ways to decompose models into more interpretable components. Our subsequent work which found millions of features in Claude 3.0 Sonnet, one of our production language models, represents progress in this direction. In our most recent work, we developed methods that allow us to build circuits using features and use these circuits to understand the mechanisms associated with a model's computation and study specific examples of multi-hop reasoning, planning, and chain-of-thought faithfulness on Claude Haiku 3.5, one of our production models.” This is a stepping stone towards our overall goal of mechanistically understanding neural networks. A few places to learn more about our work and team are this introduction to Interpretability from our research lead, Chris Olah, Stanford CS25 lecture given by Josh Batson, and TWIML AI podcast with Emmanuel Ameisen. Some of our team's notable publications include and our Circuits’ Methods and Biology papers, Scaling Monosemanticity: Extracting Interpretable Features from Claude 3 Sonnet, Towards Monosemanticity: Decomposing Language Models With Dictionary Learning, A Mathematical Framework for Transformer Circuits, In-context Learning and Induction Heads, and Toy Models of Superposition. This work builds on ideas from members' work prior to Anthropic such as the original circuits thread, Multimodal Neurons, Activation Atlases, and Building Blocks. About the role: As a manager on the Interpretability team, you'll support a team of expert researchers and engineers who are trying to understand at a deep, mechanistic level, how modern large language models work internally. Few things can accelerate this work more than great managers. Your work as manager will be critical in making sure that our fast-growing team is able to meet its ambitious safety research goals over the coming years. In this role, you will partner closely with an individual contributor research lead to drive the team's success, translating cutting-edge research ideas into tangible goals and overseeing their execution. You will manage team execution, careers and performance, facilitate relationships within and across teams, and drive the hiring pipeline. If you're more interested in making individual direct technical contributions to our research as the primary focus of your role, feel free to apply to our Research Scientist or Research Engineer roles instead. Responsibilities: Partner with a research lead on direction, project planning and execution, hiring, and people development Set and maintain a high bar for execution speed and quality, including identifying improvements to processes that help the team operate effectively Coach and support team members to have more impact and develop in their careers Drive the team's recruiting efforts, including hiring planning, process improvements, and sourcing and closing Help identify and support opportunities for collaboration with other teams across Anthropic Communicate team updates and results to other teams and leadership Maintain a deep understanding of the team's technical work and its implications for AI safety You may be a good fit if you: Are an experienced manager (minimum 2-5 years) with a track record of effectively leading highly technical research and/or engineering teams Have a background in machine learning, AI, or a related technical field Actively enjoy people management and are experienced with coaching and mentorship, performance evaluation, career development, and hiring for technical roles Have strong project management skills, including prioritization and cross-functional coordination and collaboration Have managed technical teams through periods of ambiguity and change Are a quick learner, capable of understanding and contributing to discussions on complex technical topics and are motivated to learn about our research Are a strong communicator both in speaking and in writing Believe that advanced AI systems could have a transformative effect on the world, and are passionate about helping make sure that transformation goes well Strong candidates may also have: Experience scaling engineering infrastructure Experience working on open-ended, exploratory research agendas aimed at foundational insights Some familiarity with our work and mechanistic interpretability Role Specific Location Policy: This role is expected to be in our SF office for 3 days a week. The annual compensation range for this role is listed below.

We handle the hard stuff—like payroll, health insurance, 401(k)s, and HR—so owners can focus on their craft and customers. With teams in Denver, San Francisco, and New York, we’re proud to support more than 400,000 small businesses across the country, and we’re building a workplace that represents and celebrates the customers we serve. Learn more about our Total Rewards philosophy. About the Role: We're hiring a Staff-level engineer to join our Integrated Benefits team that works on improving our existing systems for extensibility and scalability, and building the future of Gusto's Benefits ecosystem. As a Staff Software Engineer, you'll lead complex technical projects end-to-end by contributing to feature specs, designing solutions that move existing systems toward desired end states, executing on projects, and maintaining code that powers core experiences for the Integrated Benefits team. The Integrated Benefits team focuses on the integration of users' existing benefits providers and the development of Voluntary Life and Disability (vLiDi) products. In this role, you will operate as a Builder, focusing on the architecture of complex and interconnected technical systems. You will have a scaled impact across the wider Benefits engineering organization by augmenting our Product Engineering culture with reusable capabilities and solid technical foundations. We are looking for engineers who are ready to solve deep, ambiguous architectural puzzles and apply AI tools to accelerate development and deliver new product capabilities. If you’re interested in building elegant software with far-reaching effects in our modern economy, join us! About the Team: The Integrated Benefits (IB) team operates with a heart for complex challenge within the larger Gusto Benefits organization, serving as the critical link for users' existing benefits providers and the development of Voluntary Life and Disability (vLiDi) products. Our work enables customers to work with an external broker while still leveraging Gusto’s people platform to seamlessly integrate and manage their benefits. We offer the unique opportunity to solve deep, ambiguous architectural puzzles and integrate our systems with the org-wide push for AI. This high-performing, independent group values humor and casual connection, fostering an environment that enjoys pairing and problem-solving together. Here’s what you’ll do day-to-day: Serve as a technical leader within the Integrated Benefits team, mentoring engineers on your team and contributing technical expertise to cross-team initiatives within the Benefits organization. Design, build, and test the solid technical foundations and reusable \"LEGO blocks\" that support our Voluntary Life and Disability (vLiDi) products and broker integrations. Help scale our platform by architecting complex, interconnected technical systems and executing within a Ruby on Rails environment. Collaborate on complex and ambiguous problems, partnering with cross-functional teams to solve deep architectural puzzles and take existing systems closer to desired end states. Mentor and grow fellow engineers, fostering a culture of ownership and mentorship within a high-performing, self-organized team. Drive the product development process for platform capabilities, from influencing initial feature specs to maintaining code that powers core experiences. Improve the productivity of our product engineering culture by building tools and shared capabilities that allow teams to move faster. Continuously apply AI tools to accelerate development, using AI to build, test, and iterate quickly while staying curious about emerging frameworks and patterns. Here’s what we're looking for: 10+ years of professional software engineering experience with demonstrated technical leadership on complex platform or product engineering projects. Able to build maintainable, structured, well-documented code, with specific proficiency in Ruby on Rails and a strong focus on architectural patterns. Strong knowledge of data structures, data modeling, and system design, particularly within complex, interconnected systems. Experience working across multiple teams, influencing both product and team direction by advocating for technical health and reusability. Experience working on platform products which are depended upon throughout the company, ideally involving service extraction or componentization. Experience engineering, designing, building, and supporting large-scale systems in production, ensuring high reliability and scalability. Our cash compensation amount for this role is targeted at $189,000/yr to $237,000/yr in Denver & most remote locations, $223,000/yr to $279,000/yr for San Francisco, New York & Seattle and $200,000(CAD)/yr to $250,000(CAD)/yr in Canada. Stock equity is additional. Final offer amounts are determined by multiple factors including candidate experience and expertise and may vary from the amounts listed above. Gusto has physical office spaces in Denver, San Francisco, and New York City. Employees who are based in those locations will be expected to work from the office on designated days approximately 2-3 days per week (or more depending on role). The same office expectations apply to all Symmetry roles, Gusto's subsidiary, whose physical office is in Scottsdale. Note: The San Francisco office expectations encompass both the San Francisco and San Jose metro areas. When approved to work from a location other than a Gusto office, a secure, reliable, and consistent internet connection is required. This includes non-office days for hybrid employees. Our customers come from all walks of life and so do we. We hire great people from a wide variety of backgrounds, not just because it's the right thing to do, but because it makes our company stronger.
