About us Artificial Intelligence could be one of humanity’s most useful inventions. At Google DeepMind, we’re a team of scientists, engineers, machine learning experts and more, working together to advance the state of the art in artificial intelligence. We use our technologies for widespread public benefit and scientific discovery, and collaborate with others on critical challenges, ensuring safety and ethics are the highest priority. The role As we develop models with strong capabilities in the physical sciences, we are looking for Research Engineers to make sure these capabilities are always put to good use. Using your knowledge of machine learning and science, you will help design new evaluations for CBRN risk, communicate the results clearly, and ensure the safety of our AI systems. You will work closely with other Engineers and Research Scientists as well as with experts in AI ethics and policy. Key responsibilities Design and develop robust evaluations to test potential CBRN risks arising from cutting-edge AI models with strong capabilities in the physical sciences. Develop and maintain infrastructure for these evaluations. Run these evaluations prior to releases for new AI models. Resolve potential CBRN risks with state-of-the-art mitigations. Clearly communicate results to decision-makers. Collaborate with subject matter experts in CBRN, AI policy and ethics, model development, and scientific research. Develop and maintain an understanding of trends in AI development, CBRN threat landscapes, governance, and relevant sociotechnical research to inform the design of new evaluations.
