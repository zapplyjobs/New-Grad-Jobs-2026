    "job_description": "Brookhaven National Laboratory is committed to employee success and we believe that a comprehensive employee benefits program is an important and meaningful part of the compensation employees receive. Review more information at BNL | Benefits ProgramThe National Synchrotron Light Source is a state-of-the-art, medium-energy (3-billion-electron-volt, or GeV) electron storage ring that produces x-rays up to 10,000 times brighter than the NSLS. The mission of the National Synchrotron Light Source is to provide extremely bright x-rays for basic and applied research in biology and medicine, materials and chemical sciences, geosciences and environmental sciences, and nanoscience. To support this program, the NSLS-II must design, fabricate, assemble, test, install, and operate unique research equipment to generate, transport, transfer, accelerate and focus electron and X-ray beams. This includes a combination of custom designed and built parts and vendor produced components developed by a collaboration of the NSLS-II scientific, engineering, and technical staff. NSLS-II supports an international user community of over 2,200 researchers from 400 universities. NSLS-II performs all these functions in an environmentally responsible and safe manner, under a rigorous conduct of operations approach.Position DescriptionNSLS-II is seeking a Postdoctoral Research Associate to participate in our research program focused on using data-driven chaos indicators for optimization of nonlinear dynamic systems and application in accelerator design and operation. The appointment will be for 2 years.Essential Duties and Responsibilities:Work on a DoE funded Field Work ProposalWork with accelerator physics and engineering experts on online optimization of the NSLS-II accelerator complexWorking with accelerator physics and engineering experts to create a digital twin for the NSLS-II accelerator complexWork with NSLS-II upgrade workgroup on the design and optimization of the NSLS-IIU lattice candidatesGive presentations and report ongoing workPresent technical papers at conferences and publish in peer-reviewed journalsRequired Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities:Ph.D. degree in physics or related discipline, with a concentration in accelerators physics and nonlinear dynamicsExperience in working with particle accelerators through the control systemsKnowledge of one or more programming language for physics simulations, accelerator commissioning and data analysis, such as Python, JuliaAbility to perform detailed simulations of the physical processes being studied. This includes the simulation of particle beams and their transport in complex ring lattices using the codes ELEGANT, BMAD, or MADSome fundamental knowledge on machine learning, data science and related numerical tools, such as Scilearn-kit, PyTorchPreferred Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities:Knowledge of particle accelerators and emerging particle acceleration techniques and technologiesExperience with Python, MatLab or Julia programming language in online machine controlKnowledge of machine learning, data science and related numerical tools, such as Scilearn-kit, PyTorchEnvironmental, Health & Safety Requirements:May be required to occasionally work off-hours, nights and/or weekends to support mission critical projectsOther Information: Work arrangement: On-siteCandidates must have received a Ph.D. by the commencement of employment.  BNL policy requires that after obtaining their PhD, eligible candidates for research associate appointments may not exceed a combined total of 5 years of relevant work experience as a post-doc and/or in an R&D position, excluding time associated with family planning, military service, illness or other life-changing events. Brookhaven National Laboratory is committed to providing fair, equitable and competitive compensation. The full salary range for this position is $71,900.00 - $88,000.00 / year. Salary offers will be commensurate with the final candidate’s qualification, education and experience and considered with the internal peer group. Brookhaven National Laboratory requires all non-badged personnel including visitors to produce a REAL-ID or REAL-ID compliant documentation to access Brookhaven National Laboratory – view more information at www.bnl.gov/real-id.  This is due to nationwide identification requirements for federal site access as required by the federal REAL ID Act.  Those not in possession of a REAL ID-compliant document will not be permitted to access the site which includes access to the Laboratory for interviews. About UsBrookhaven National Laboratory (www.bnl.gov) delivers discovery science and transformative technology to power and secure the nation’s future.
