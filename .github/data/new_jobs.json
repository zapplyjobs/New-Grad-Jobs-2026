How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

By deeply integrating proprietary financial data with product and platform infrastructure, we’re turning complex financial operations into simple, automated experiences and setting a new standard for how modern finance works.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;What you’ll do&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You’ll be the senior technical owner of the Brex Assistant: a consumer-facing conversation product and will lead the rollout of the Assistant experience — defining what “great” looks like, sequencing capabilities deliberately, and shipping a product that is reliable, opinionated, and genuinely useful. You’ll write a significant amount of production code, set the quality bar, and shape how agentic systems integrate with Brex’s core workflows.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is a deeply product-driven role. Success is measured by better outcomes for customers — higher-quality expense documentation, stronger policy compliance, and less time spent clicking around Brex.com — not by novelty or research output.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Where you’ll work&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This role will be based in our Seattle office. We are a hybrid environment that combines the energy and connections of being in the office with the benefits and flexibility of working from home. We currently require a minimum of two coordinated days in the office per week, Wednesday and Thursday. Starting February 2, 2026, we will require three days per week in office - Monday, Wednesday and Thursday. As a perk, we also have up to four weeks per year of fully remote work!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Responsibilities&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Own the end-to-end conversational experience for the Brex Assistant, including both outbound system-initiated interactions and inbound mobile chat.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Act as the technical and product bar-setter for the team, making and executing hard sequencing decisions for assistant capabilities (e.g., memory, merchant data, preferences).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Write high-quality, production-grade code while shaping architecture and interfaces for agentic workflows, partnering closely with Spend/Expense teams to influence core Brex workflows.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Set and enforce a high bar for reliability, correctness, and UX in a non-deterministic system, collaborating with infrastructure and security teams for deep integration.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Establish team norms and best practices for building agentic products, focusing on overcommunication, validation, and quality control.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Requirements&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Proven experience building and owning user-facing software products in complex, real-world domains.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Established experience as a Staff / Senior Staff engineer or hands-on Tech Lead; prior people management experience is a strong plus.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Strong product judgment: a track record of making hard tradeoffs, sticking to them, and delivering outcomes under real constraints.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Experience building systems that must be reliable despite messy inputs — whether from users, non-deterministic systems, or both.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Ability to independently own UX and roadmap decisions, build simple and robust user-centric software, and mentor junior engineers through strong product and technical guidance.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Bonus points&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Experience working on consumer or prosumer products in regulated or high-stakes domains (finance, healthcare, travel, etc.).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Direct experience with conversational UX, agents, or other non-deterministic systems in production.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Personal empathy for spend-heavy workflows (frequent travel, recruiting, managing expenses on behalf of a company).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Compensation:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The expected salary range for this role is $192,000 - $240,000.
