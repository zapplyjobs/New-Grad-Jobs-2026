More than 500,000 organizations, including 80% of the Fortune 100, rely on Airtable to transform how work gets done.Join Airtable as a Product Security Engineer and play a pivotal role in shaping the security of our rapidly evolving platform as we expand our AI and LLM-powered offerings. You will join the team responsible for safeguarding the application layer of Airtable’s platform. You will partner closely with product engineering teams to build paved roads, frameworks, and automated controls that make the secure path the easy path for our engineering teams. You will help influence application security at scale, ensuring our products are secure by design. What you'll do Develop self-service security frameworks and \"paved roads\" that allow engineering teams to ship secure code by default. Focus on automated guardrails for common vulnerabilities, while prioritizing deep-dive design reviews into complex business logic and data isolation issues (for example, multi-tenant isolation and authorization/permission bypasses) that automated tools cannot catch. Partner with product and engineering teams to review designs early, contribute to threat modeling for new features and complex initiatives, and provide clear, actionable security guidance. Research emerging threats and evolving best practices, specifically regarding AI and LLM safety, and implement controls to secure these workflows. Manage and evolve our approach to external penetration testing and bug bounties, driving remediation for findings and treating vulnerability management as an engineering problem. Contribute to the long-term roadmaps, metrics, and strategic planning for the security team. (Senior/Staff L5+) Lead complex threat modeling sessions for major product launches and define secure coding standards, and actively mentor other engineers to raise the technical security bar across the organization. Who you are 4+ years of experience in product security or application security, with experience shipping production code. Please note this is not an early career position. You have a strong background in computer science or a related field, with proficiency in writing clean, maintainable code. You have deep familiarity with JavaScript or TypeScript, Node.js, and modern web application frameworks, and can reason about the security implications of systems built on them. You have hands-on experience securing LLM integrations and identifying prompt injection or data leakage risks. You are proficient in writing and reviewing code and treat security as an engineering problem to be solved with software, not just policies. You excel at communicating complex security risks to non-security stakeholders and enjoy collaborating cross-functionally to find solutions that balance security with engineering velocity. You are comfortable working in a fast-paced environment, navigating ambiguity, continuously learning about emerging threats and technologies, and contributing to long-term security strategy.

More than 500,000 organizations, including 80% of the Fortune 100, rely on Airtable to transform how work gets done.Airtable’s infrastructure is evolving to meet the needs of our fast growing engineering org. We are looking for backend engineers to join our team to help improve critical product infrastructure, with a focus on building systems that have a great developer experience and will scale as we grow. We currently have openings on: Base Infrastructure: The Base Infrastructure team owns the system that powers the core of Airtable’s product--serving Airtable bases. We are investing in the foundations of our homegrown in-memory database. Key projects include building replication to support zero downtime failovers, optimizing performance and memory usage, and vertical scaling. Compute: The compute pod builds and manages our Kubernetes-based platform that supports every service at Airtable, including all new AI services such as vector databases, AI evals store, and document extraction and understanding services. We have a lot of exciting foundational work in our roadmap, such as Overhauling our network stack and service discovery, to simplify service setup and strengthen security Region level disaster recovery, and bringing up compute platform from 0->1 in a new region Building custom Kubernetes operators for reliably managing some of our most critical workloads Data Infrastructure: The Data Infrastructure team’s mission is to enable data-driven decision making at Airtable by providing reliable, self-service, high-performance analytics infrastructure. We use technologies like Apache Spark, Kafka, and Apache Flink to process vast quantities of data in our data warehouse. This infrastructure is used by Airtable’s data engineers and analysts, as well as product developers building features powered by business data.The team is focused on scaling to petabyte volume, enabling sub-second streaming, tightening data governance, and delivering cost efficient ML-ready datasets to power Airtable’s native AI products with fresh, high quality signals. Developer Platform: The Developer Platform team sits at the intersection of all engineering at Airtable, focusing on building the internal tooling, frameworks, and CI/CD systems that power our product teams. We strive to streamline developer workflows—from build and test cycles to production deployments—and foster a best-in-class developer experience. Join us if you’re passionate about creating high-leverage solutions that enable engineers to deliver features quickly, reliably, and at scale.

We use RDS MySQL, DynamoDB, Redis, and TiDB. We’re looking for folks interested in distributed systems and databases who are excited to work on business-critical, petabyte-scale storage systems. You will own all aspects of building, running, and improving these systems, from the underlying infrastructure all the way to the developer-facing code abstractions. Traffic: We are looking for founding members of our Traffic Engineering team. We recently formed a Traffic Infrastructure team to ensure that traffic across Airtable’s network and routing infrastructure is managed in a reliable, flexible, and secure manner. This will support improved performance in our secondary regions (EU and Australia) as well as other customer-driven projects.

More than 500,000 organizations, including 80% of the Fortune 100, rely on Airtable to transform how work gets done.Airtable is the no-code app platform that empowers people closest to the work to accelerate their most critical business processes. More than 500,000 organizations, including 80% of the Fortune 100, rely on Airtable to transform how work gets done. We’re investing deeply in AI to make app building faster, smarter, and more accessible—so anyone can go from an idea to a working Airtable app in minutes. We're looking for an Engineering Manager to lead Airtable's AI Platform pod, which builds the foundational infrastructure and systems that power AI experiences across Airtable. You’ll own the core agent architecture, AI evaluation systems, and platform capabilities that empower internal teams and end users to leverage AI effectively. Your team will be responsible for making AI reliable, scalable, and accessible throughout Airtable–from the underlying agent runtime that orchestrates complex workflows to the semantic search infrastructure that helps users find exactly what they need and powers rich features like linked-record matching. Please note: while we employ a hybrid working model at Airtable (flexible in working from the office or elsewhere), we are looking to hire candidates at this level that are based in San Francisco or New York City who are open to coming into the office at least ~2-3 times/week for team collaboration. What you’ll do Build the AI platform foundation: Own the core agent architecture, orchestration layer, and runtime that powers all AI experiences across Airtable—ensuring it's extensible, reliable, and can scale to support diverse use cases across multiple teams Design for platform scale: Create robust abstractions and APIs that enable other teams to build AI-powered features quickly and safely, while maintaining quality and consistency across the product Establish AI reliability systems: Build comprehensive evaluation frameworks, monitoring, and quality assurance systems that ensure AI features meet enterprise-grade standards for accuracy, performance, and safety Drive technical strategy: Partner with Staff+ engineers to define the technical roadmap for Airtable's AI infrastructure, making architectural decisions that will shape how we build with AI for years to come Enable AI democratization: Build platform capabilities that make sophisticated AI accessible to all Airtable users—from semantic search and natural language interfaces to intelligent automation—without requiring technical expertise Who you are Platform builder at heart: You think in systems and abstractions. You've built infrastructure that other teams depend on and understand how to balance flexibility with reliability Technical depth with strategic thinking: You can dive deep into architectural decisions while keeping sight of the broader platform vision and how it enables the business Systems thinker with shipping velocity: You can architect for the long term while delivering incremental value. You know how to build platforms through iteration rather than big-bang releases AI infrastructure experience: You've worked on ML platforms, agent frameworks, or AI infrastructure at scale. You understand the unique challenges of building reliable systems on top of probabilistic models Quality through architecture: You believe the best way to ensure quality isn't through process but through well-designed systems—building platforms that make it easy to do the right thing Strong technical and management growth trajectory: 5+ years experience as an engineer (previously in a staff or TL level IC position) and 1+ years as a manager, or a similar combination.

We welcome people of different backgrounds, experiences, abilities, and perspectives.
