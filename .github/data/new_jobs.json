We help companies spend with confidence with integrated corporate cards, banking, and global payments, plus intuitive software for travel and expenses. Tens of thousands of companies from startups to enterprises — including DoorDash, Flexport, and Compass — use Brex to proactively control spend, reduce costs, and increase efficiency on a global scale.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Working at Brex allows you to push your limits, challenge the status quo, and collaborate with some of the brightest minds in the industry. We’re committed to building a diverse team and inclusive culture and believe your potential should only be limited by how big you can dream. We make this a reality by empowering you with the tools, resources, and support you need to grow your career.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The People team builds and sustains the culture that powers Brex. We focus on talent, growth, and the employee experience — creating an environment where high-agency individuals can thrive. From hiring to development, we design systems that grow with scale and challenge people to reach their potential. It’s a team for builders, coaches, and culture-shapers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you&#39;ll do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We’re looking for a seasoned Head of Internal Communications to lead how we communicate strategy, culture, and change across Brex. This role sits at the intersection of business strategy, leadership communication, and organizational storytelling. You’ll work closely with the CEO, CPO, and President to ensure every employee deeply understands where we’re going, why it matters, and how their work connects to company goals.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is not a traditional “newsletter and all-hands” role. The ideal candidate will be both a strategic business translator and a creative storyteller, capable of simplifying complex business narratives (financial performance, AI strategy, etc) into clear and compelling messages.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where you&#39;ll work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This role will be based in our San Francisco office. We are a hybrid environment that combines the energy and connections of being in the office with the benefits and flexibility of working from home. We currently require a minimum of two coordinated days in the office per week, Wednesday and Thursday. Starting February 2, 2026, we will require three days per week in office - Monday, Wednesday and Thursday. As a perk, we also have up to four weeks per year of fully remote work.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilites&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drive strategic clarity:&lt;/strong&gt; Partner with Brex’s leadership team to distill business strategy, financial performance, and company priorities into clear narratives employees can act on and easily understand&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Own executive communications:&lt;/strong&gt; Key driver &amp;amp; partner for CEO and exec messages (all-hands, board updates, internal memos, video scripts, etc.) that reflect transparency, accountability, and inspiration about where the business is going&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prepare for public company readiness:&lt;/strong&gt; Develop internal comms strategies for public-company-level transparency, governance education, and narrative discipline. Partner with Legal, Finance, and PR/IR to ensure message consistency&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lead organizational storytelling:&lt;/strong&gt; Build a unified internal narrative that connects our culture (“Be the Founder of Your Career”) with business outcomes and customer impact.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengthen change communication:&lt;/strong&gt; Create communication frameworks that help leaders navigate transformation&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evolve channels and cadence:&lt;/strong&gt; Modernize our communication systems (Slack, all-hands, internal podcasts, etc.) to reach employees where they are—measured by engagement and understanding of our business, not volume&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coach leaders as communicators:&lt;/strong&gt; Elevate Brex’s leadership bench by developing communication toolkits, templates, and feedback loops that help managers become stronger business translators&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requirements&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;10+ years of experience in internal communications, executive communications, or corporate affairs, ideally in high-growth technology or fintech companies&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Highly business-savvy: understands P&amp;amp;L drivers, strategy execution, and how communications can drive alignment and results&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience in a public company or late-stage IPO environment; understands regulatory, disclosure, and change-management nuances&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Exceptional writer and storyteller—able to translate complex ideas into plain, memorable language&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Trusted advisor to executives—comfortable navigating sensitive topics and balancing transparency with discretion&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Creative and adaptable: comfortable using AI-powered tools, data-driven measurement, and modern content formats to evolve how Brex communicates&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Passionate about Brex’s mission and culture of ownership, impact, and learning&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compensation&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The expected salary range for this role is $221,480 - $276,850.&amp;nbsp; However, the starting base pay will depend on a number of factors including the candidate’s location, skills, experience, market demands, and internal pay parity.
