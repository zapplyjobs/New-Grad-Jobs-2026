We’ve built AI-powered technology that helps healthcare providers deliver safer, higher-quality care - starting with the first real-time medical review platform built to fix clinical and compliance risks before they impact patients. Each year, 1 in 20 people in the U.S. experiences a medical diagnostic or compliance-related mistake. Most providers lack the time, staffing, and tools to mitigate these issues - so they go unnoticed, impacting care quality and increasing clinical and financial risk. Brellium is building the AI-powered platform that helps providers deliver safer, more consistent care by mitigating risk early and aligning patient visits with clinical best practices. Our goal is to give every provider in the U.S. the tools to deliver clinically excellent, data-driven care - at scale. Brellium was founded in 2021.
