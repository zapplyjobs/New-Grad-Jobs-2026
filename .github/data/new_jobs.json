    "job_description": "Organizational Overview Do you want to help ensure that every organizer, advocate, and changemaker in the progressive movement has what they need to create bold, people-powered change? Join us in making that vision a reality. Launched in 2018, The Movement Cooperative (TMC) is a nonprofit member cooperative uniting more than 90 national and state-based organizations and over 1,400 affiliates through shared infrastructure and collaborative support. We bridge the gap between vision and capacity—democratizing access to tools, data, and strategic expertise that help our members organize more efficiently, campaign more effectively, and drive lasting impact across the movement. As a cooperative, TMC is governed by and for its members, with a board(s) made up primarily of staff from member organizations. Together, we’re reimagining what’s possible when movement groups have the infrastructure they need to thrive. Position Overview TMC membership gives organizations access to our data warehouse and analytics platform and access to national voter/consumer files along with a wealth of other communal data resources. The Data & Technology department is the key to making the large amount of data available through TMC accessible and digestible to these organizations. The Data Associate provides the technical assistance that our member organizations need to get started and then ongoing support to utilize the data and technology resources from their TMC membership. Data Associates will ensure that members’ immediate data and access needs are met, and that our team is organized internally and delivering high-quality work. This is an excellent role for someone just starting their data career or transitioning into data. This role has substantial opportunity for growth and development and is a potential stepping stone to becoming a Data Analyst or Solutions & Analytics Engineer. Data Associates sit on the Solutions & Analytics Engineering team within the larger Data & Technology Strategy Department.
