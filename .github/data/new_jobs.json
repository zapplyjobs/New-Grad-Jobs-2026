We operate at high scale - trillions of data points per day - providing always-on alerting, metrics visualization, logs, and application tracing for tens of thousands of companies. Our engineering culture values pragmatism, honesty, and simplicity to solve hard problems the right way.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Opportunity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Query Experience is the organization responsible for defining and delivering the unified interface through which all internal and external users query and interact with data at Datadog.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We build the APIs, planning layers, semantic infrastructure, and UI platforms that power querying across all telemetry data types—metrics, logs, traces, events, and more. Our work spans developer experience, natural language interfaces, schema-aware querying, and intelligent access patterns.&amp;nbsp;Together, we support hundreds of engineers, countless dashboards, AI agents, monitors, and backend systems across Datadog.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Datadog is building the next generation of federated query systems, enabling:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Cross-org &amp;amp; cross-region querying for exec dashboards and incident response&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Federated search into customer-managed stores&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Data sovereignty–aware federation, where sensitive fields are controlled&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;At Datadog, we place value in our office culture - the relationships and collaboration it builds and the creativity it brings to the table.
