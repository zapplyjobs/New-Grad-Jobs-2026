But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.Your safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

Blissway is a startup that simplifies the collection of tolls and greatly improves highway safety. In a way, we are multiple startups in one: deep tech, AI/ML, fintech, hardware, SaaS, IoT, transportation, and GovTech.

Excel at solving hard problems and take full ownership. We expect you to figure out what you need to get stuff done. Flexible to help all areas of the company when other teams need a boost. Usually this is a great opportunity to learn and get exposure to new tech. If you are uncomfortable with the idea of fluid teams or only want to work on niche things, this will not be a good fit. We have extremely talented SWE team members who want you to learn and succeed. They will guide you but this would be a bad fit if you are hoping a training program, you must throw yourself at the problems. If you want to learn more, let's talk!",

How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

    "job_description": "Discord is used by over 200 million people every month for many different reasons, but there’s one thing that nearly everyone does on our platform: play video games. Over 90% of our users play games, spending a combined 1.5 billion hours playing thousands of unique titles on Discord each month. Discord plays a uniquely important role in the future of gaming. We are focused on making it easier and more fun for people to talk and hang out before, during, and after playing games.More broadly, Discord is about empowering people to find belonging in all kinds of communities, and those people trust us to keep their communications safe. Our Platform Security Engineering team protects the systems we use to create Discord, making the “secure way” the “easy way.” We’re looking for a Senior Engineer to advance this mission through security expertise, software development, and operational excellence. In this role, you’ll help identify leveraged opportunities to reduce security risk across Engineering and then you’ll design and deliver technical solutions—lovable “paved paths” for managing identities and access, shipping code, configuring cloud infrastructure, and operating services. If you’re a security engineer who’s deeply curious, eager to own technically and socially complex projects, and excited to improve security and privacy at Discord, read on! What you'll do Own software engineering projects end-to-end on a highly-autonomous and horizontally-integrated team with a lot of leverage. This is a code-forward role! Develop and apply best-in-class secure baselines for cloud infrastructure. Secure first- and third-party software supply chains, from the dev environment through CI/CD and into production. Build and operate identity and access management (IAM) systems that are user-friendly and promote least privilege. Manage infrastructure vulnerabilities while supporting rapid growth for Engineering.
