    "job_description": "At Datadog, we're on a relentless mission to build the best platform in the world for engineers to truly understand and scale their systems, applications, and teams. Operating at an unprecedented scale - processing trillions of data points per day - we empower seamless collaboration and problem-solving for tens of thousands of companies globally. Our engineering culture thrives on pragmatism, honesty, and simplicity, tackling complex challenges the right way. SDLC ObservabilityDatadog's Software Delivery Platform starts with a comprehensive, end-to-end visibility across the entire SDLC, helping customers catch issues before production, optimize costs, and accelerate delivery. Our product suite includes granular insights into CI/CD pipelines, intelligent test management and optimization, code quality gates, and automated DORA metrics across every major CI provider. This is more than monitoring; it's about preventing failures, removing bottlenecks and eliminating developer disruptions at scale.Runtime, Machine learning and CuriosityThis role requires a continued curiosity to explore uncharted spaces while innovating in more established ones. With the rise of AI-generated code, the volume of Pull Requests, CI runs, and Tests is growing fast, creating more noise, higher costs, and new bottlenecks for engineering teams.We’re tackling the impact of that growth on SDLC by absorbing and root-cause fixing CI instability, and generating/updating/orchestrating thousands of tests using production signals and quantifying how AI impacts SDLC. We have an appetite to solve hard problems in clever ways. Our users trust us with their observability data and we work hard to put it to good use for them. At Datadog, we are looking for a Product Manager II to help us evolve the Software Delivery Suit to work on all these spaces to help developers ship faster, safer, and with less cognitive load. At Datadog, we place value in our office culture - the relationships and collaboration it builds, and the creativity it brings to the table. We operate as a hybrid workplace to ensure our Datadogs can create a work-life harmony that best fits them.What You’ll DoUncover Developer / Platform Eng Needs: You will conduct user research and analyze usage data to understand how teams at different scales (from startups to massive enterprises) struggle with pipeline noise, testing and deployment risk.Owning and accelerating parts of the Software Delivery business: Drive adoption of CI/CD Visibility, Test Optimization, and Code Quality products, optimize customer onboarding, and ensure robust revenue growth across Platform Engineers and Developers.Define the experience: From intuitive pipeline visibility to intelligent test selection, quality gates, and Auto Test generation - ensuring every developer ships code with confidence and speed.Strategize to win the market: Partner with Product Marketing and Sales to perfect positioning while enabling field teams to articulate how we help in the larger Datadog suite.Who You AreProduct Thinker: You have 3-5 years of experience in Product Management or a combined background in Engineering/DevOps and Product. You understand how to break down big problems into shippable iterations.Developer Empathy: You have a technical background or a strong familiarity with the SDLC. You understand concepts like CI pipelines (GitHub Actions, GitLab), Test Flakiness, Deployment strategies (Canary, Blue/Green), and why developers hate being blocked by infrastructure.Data-Driven: You are comfortable with analytics tools to query usage data, prove a hypothesis, and measure the success of a feature launch.Adaptable: You are comfortable with ambiguity. Our strategy involves moving fast to solve new problems created by AI coding assistants; you are excited to pivot focus between Testing, CI, and Deployments based on where the biggest value lies.Collaborator: You have excellent communication skills and can work effectively with distributed engineering teams, building consensus and keeping projects on track.Datadog values people from all walks of life. We understand not everyone will meet all the above qualifications on day one. That's okay.

    "description": "&lt;p&gt;At Datadog, we&#39;re on a relentless mission to build the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;best platform in the world &lt;/strong&gt;for engineers to truly understand and scale their systems, applications, and teams. Operating at an &lt;strong&gt;unprecedented scale&lt;/strong&gt; - processing trillions of data points per day - we empower seamless collaboration and problem-solving for tens of thousands of companies globally. Our engineering culture thrives on pragmatism, honesty, and simplicity, tackling complex challenges the right way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SDLC Observability &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Datadog&#39;s Software Delivery Platform starts with a comprehensive, end-to-end visibility across the entire SDLC, helping customers catch issues before production, optimize costs, and accelerate delivery. Our product suite includes granular insights into CI/CD pipelines, intelligent test management and optimization, code quality gates, and automated DORA metrics across every major CI provider. This is more than monitoring; it&#39;s about preventing failures, removing bottlenecks and eliminating developer disruptions at scale.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Runtime, Machine learning and Curiosity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This role requires a continued curiosity to explore uncharted spaces while innovating in more established ones. With the rise of AI-generated code, the volume of Pull Requests, CI runs, and Tests is growing fast, creating more noise, higher costs, and new bottlenecks for engineering teams.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We’re tackling the impact of that growth on SDLC by absorbing and root-cause fixing CI instability, and generating/updating/orchestrating thousands of tests using production signals and quantifying how AI impacts SDLC. We have an appetite to solve hard problems in clever ways. Our users trust us with their observability data and we work hard to put it to good use for them.&amp;nbsp;At Datadog, we are looking for a &lt;strong&gt;Product Manager II&lt;/strong&gt; to help us evolve the &lt;strong&gt;Software Delivery Suit to work on all these spaces&lt;/strong&gt; to help developers ship faster, safer, and with less cognitive&amp;nbsp;load.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;At Datadog, we place value in our office culture - the relationships and collaboration it builds, and the creativity it brings to the table. We operate as a hybrid workplace to ensure our Datadogs can create a work-life harmony that best fits them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What You’ll Do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uncover Developer / Platform Eng Needs: &lt;/strong&gt;You will conduct user research and analyze&amp;nbsp;usage data to understand how teams at different scales (from startups to massive&amp;nbsp;enterprises) struggle with pipeline noise, testing and deployment risk.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Owning and accelerating parts of the Software Delivery business: &lt;/strong&gt;Drive adoption of&amp;nbsp;CI/CD Visibility, Test Optimization, and Code Quality products, optimize customer&amp;nbsp;onboarding, and ensure robust revenue growth across Platform Engineers and&amp;nbsp;Developers.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Define the experience: &lt;/strong&gt;From intuitive pipeline visibility to intelligent test selection,&amp;nbsp;quality gates, and Auto Test generation - ensuring every developer ships code with&amp;nbsp;confidence and speed.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategize to win the market:&lt;/strong&gt; Partner with Product Marketing and Sales to perfect&amp;nbsp;positioning while enabling field teams to articulate how we help in the larger Datadog&amp;nbsp;suite.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who You Are&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Product Thinker:&lt;/strong&gt; You have &lt;strong&gt;3-5 years of experience&lt;/strong&gt; in Product Management or a&amp;nbsp;combined background in Engineering/DevOps and Product.

You understand concepts like &lt;strong&gt;CI pipelines (GitHub Actions, GitLab), Test&amp;nbsp;Flakiness, Deployment strategies (Canary, Blue/Green)&lt;/strong&gt;, and why developers hate&amp;nbsp;being blocked by infrastructure.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data-Driven: &lt;/strong&gt;You are comfortable with analytics tools to query usage data, prove a&amp;nbsp;hypothesis, and measure the success of a feature launch.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adaptable:&lt;/strong&gt; You are comfortable with ambiguity.
