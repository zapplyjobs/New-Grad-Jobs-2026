    "job_description": "About Anthropic Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems. About the role We're looking for an experienced software engineer to join our Enterprise Product Engineering team as we rapidly scale our Claude for Work product. The team is organized into two pods: Enterprise Activation focuses on transforming Claude from a chat interface into a true \"virtual collaborator\" for every knowledge worker. This includes building primitives that bundle AI capabilities into deployable, customizable units—as well as working closely with customers to develop 1st party MCPs and capabilities to support top use cases (e.g. Data Analyst, Legal, FSI), and expanding Claude's presence across core knowledge worker surfaces like Slack and Microsoft Teams. Enterprise Foundations. focuses on creating a unified Anthropic platform for enterprise deployments. This includes building billing infrastructure, management for groups and permissions, and a seamless admin experience that provides a single view across all products and organizations. You will work closely with product, design, GTM, and Applied AI teams to deliver products that drive adoption, expansion, and retention of Claude in Fortune 500 companies. Core Responsibilities Develop products to maximize adoption and expansion of cutting-edge AI applications amongst knowledge workers Design, build, and ship enterprise-grade products with high standards for security, reliability, and scalability Build scalable systems for user management, admin controls, billing infrastructure, and consumption pricing Create seamless end-user experiences including OAuth flows, guided setup, and smart defaults for package installation and customization You might be a good fit if you have: 8+ years of experience as a product-minded software engineer with experience building user-centric enterprise products A track record of building systems that successfully scale from small business to enterprise customers Strong communication skills and ability to work effectively across functions Ability and motivation to work effectively in a fast-moving, ambiguous environment with minimal direction Strong Candidates May Also Have: Background in SaaS platforms with high enterprise adoption, particularly billing systems, RBAC, or admin tooling Experience working with AI/ML models and agentic workflows and understanding their capabilities Experience collaborating with GTM and applied AI teams to drive enterprise adoption and expansion The expected base compensation for this position is below. Our total compensation package for full-time employees includes equity, benefits, and may include incentive compensation.Annual Salary:$320,000 - $485,000 USDLogistics Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices. Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team. How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.
