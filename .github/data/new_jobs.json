    "job_description": "BackgroundAt Yuzu, we’re building the next-generation health insurance company. We are NOT building a digital brokerage or an AI wrapper - we are going deeper to build the foundational infrastructure required to power tomorrow’s health plans. We believe that software can unlock the ability to build health insurance that is affordable, adaptable, and scalable. Yuzu’s platform will be core to this future.So how does this actually work? Over 70% of employer-sponsored health plans are self-funded, meaning the employer acts as the insurer and directly covers employees' healthcare costs. This allows companies to customize benefits, gain flexibility, and save money. Self-funded employers partner with a Third-Party Administrator (TPA) to handle the behind-the-scenes plan administration, like processing claims and managing benefits.The TPA industry is a $500bn sleeper industry that has historically been seen as a services business, bogged down by manual processes and legacy systems (for context, our team couldn’t even access these on our Macs).Yuzu is a vertically integrated & tech-enabled TPA, currently servicing thousands of employees. We differentiate by helping innovative health plans come to life by facilitating new ways to pay for and access healthcare covered by insurance. Yuzu’s goal is to make it as easy for any business to create and manage a custom health plan as it is to create a storefront on Shopify.We’re backed by top VC firms and 10+ unicorn founders, including leaders at Stripe, OpenAI, Brex, Deel, Mercury, and Notion, and we’re building a formidable team to tackle the massive opportunity ahead.RoleAs an early-stage startup, Yuzu’s top priority is to ship software fast. We believe that the best way to ship code fast is to invest in clean code, strong CI/CD automation, and a delightful developer experience.Write in Typescript using modern frameworks like SvelteKit and NestjsWrite all of our infrastructure as code, improving security, modularity, and readabilityBuild on top of best-in-class healthcare APIs including Stedi and Flexpa to handle the intricacies of healthcare-specific data structures.Have a clean and new codebase, with little-to-no tech-debt or internal tools with steep learning curvesAs an early employee you willContribute across the entire codebaseSet a large part of Yuzu’s company cultureDirect the focus of our product from an engineering perspectiveQualificationsExperience building successful software projects, ideally independently or as a part of a small team or early-stage startupIn-person 5 days/week in Flatiron NYC office requiredSelf-directed, curious, fast-paced personality with strong communication skillsNice to HavesExperience with Typescript, CDK, and/or AWSExperience in healthcare or fintech infrastructureOur Commitment to YouYou will have significant ownership.
