How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

How we're different We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences. Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

You should be passionate about building at the intersection of program design, automation, and executive stakeholder management.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Responsibilities:&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Design and execute scaled activation programs (webinars, onboarding cohorts, office hours, executive events) that reach hundreds of portfolio companies across multiple PE firms&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Develop portfolio-specific commercial strategies including preferred pricing models, contract terms, and growth initiatives aligned with PE firm objectives&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Own portfolio activation metrics including new customer acquisition, ARR growth, and product engagement across Claude for Work, Claude Code, and API&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Manage relationships with PE firm Operating Partners and Value Creation teams, delivering monthly business reviews and quarterly adoption reports&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Create enablement content, documentation, and training to help portfolio companies effectively utilize Claude products, and enable Account Executives to navigate PE portfolio dynamics&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Gather product feedback from portfolio companies and represent their needs to inform Anthropic&#39;s product roadmap and PE-specific features&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Plan and execute portfolio-focused events, campaigns, and promotions including on-site executive summits and virtual programming&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Coordinate with Account Executives to route qualified leads from portfolio companies and ensure smooth handoffs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Track and report on key metrics to measure the success and ROI of portfolio activation initiatives&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Continuously refine programs based on data, feedback, and portfolio company outcomes, building a repeatable playbook that scales across firms&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;You may be a good fit if you:&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have 5-7 years of experience in B2B SaaS program management, partnerships, sales enablement, revenue operations, or customer education with a proven track record of building scaled programs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Possess strong automation skills and systems thinking—you&#39;re comfortable building workflows and infrastructure that eliminate manual work&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have experience presenting to and managing relationships with senior executives (VP+ level), translating technical concepts into business value&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Demonstrate a track record of moving fast in ambiguous environments and launching programs quickly with imperfect information&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are comfortable working with technical products and developer tools—you don&#39;t need to code, but you should understand AI concepts well enough to explain them clearly&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Show self-sufficiency and resourcefulness—you can pull together content, coordinate across teams, and execute without constant oversight&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Possess analytical orientation toward metrics and a bias toward measuring what matters (pipeline, revenue, adoption) vs. vanity metrics&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have exceptional communication and relationship-building skills with both technical and business audiences&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Can thrive in a fast-paced environment and adapt to changing priorities&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are passionate about the positive impact that AI can have for businesses and society as a whole&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Strong candidates may have:&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Direct experience working with private equity firms, portfolio companies, or leading partnership programs at a major technology company&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Existing relationships with PE Operating Partners, Value Creation teams, or portfolio company executives&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience developing commercial terms, pricing strategies, or partnership agreements&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Background in developer tools, infrastructure, or technical B2B products&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Prior sales operations, revenue operations, or sales enablement experience with a focus on enabling sales teams on complex technical products&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with large language models and their applications in areas like code modernization, software development, and business automation&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Technical background in computer science, software engineering, or related field&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;MBA or advanced degree in relevant discipline&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The annual compensation range for this role is below. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (&quot;OTE&quot;) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.

However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day.

At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",
